A lot of people think that people who watch sport shows on TV or visit sport games in real life waste their time. I personally disadree with this opinion because there are many reasons why watching sports can be useful for people.
Firstly, young boys and girls can remember the rules of some sport game or some kind of sport during watching how adult sportsmen play it. It can teach them may be even better than their parents or trainers.
Secondly, sometimes children can take a great motivation looking on their favourite sportsmen. Some of them can decided to be sportsman when he or she will become adult. Besides, kids who practise some sport are more healthy and strong than others.
Moreover, some people watch sports events or sport TV shows because they like the feelings which they have. It is so exciting to look how people from different countries try to become the winners.
However, I can understend people who agree with first point of view. Often people spend o lot of time near the TV set watching such shows. They do not remember about housework and their duties. When situation become like that men should carefully control themselves and decrease the time near the TV set.
In conclusion, it is important to note that both this opinions have the right to exist. And every person can make the desition for his own life: watch sport events or not. On the one hand, it can be good motivation for changes in their lives. On the other hand, sometimes it is very difficult to control the time which they lose for that.
