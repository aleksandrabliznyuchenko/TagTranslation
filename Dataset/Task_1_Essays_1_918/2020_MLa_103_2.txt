Sports have always been the kind of entertainment that brings people together and sometimes helps them to forget about their problems. Nevertheless, some people suppose that watching sports is useless activity that do not possess any brain activity. Actually, I agree with the second point of view, and I am going to support my opinion with some arguments.
To start with, there is a variety of activities that could be done instead of television. For example, learning new language or teaching programming by yourself. Secondly, simply not watching but doing sports by yourself, for instance, swimming, exercising in gym or jogging in park or around some buildings or neighboorhood. Finally, there are myriad of ways of spending your leisure time with relatives and friends such as carting, playing volleyball, basketball or hockey.
However, there is an opposing suggestion that watching sports on TV channels is not useless. To start with, it should be said that people in bars, pubs and cafes talk about routine and everyday problems while watching these programmes. Then, it is one of the most efficient ways to develop communication skills by speaking with other sports fans in order to be in touch with recent news. Also, during the match people blow out negative emotions and become less stressed after the match.
In conclusion, it ought to be mentioned that watching sports events on TV unite people from various social classes, professions, religions and statuses. Nevertheless, there are other ways of spending free time intellectually and socially.
