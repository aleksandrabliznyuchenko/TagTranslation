There are people who belive that watching sports and not participating is a wastage of person's free time. I completely disagree with this statement and consider that doing this still show certain positive effects on the beholder of a game.
First of all, while watching sport games or sport competitions, no matter on TV or in the stadium, the person can encourage a team and individual player to contunie to fight, to play or something else. It is vital for athletes to see someone in the stands, becouse it makes them motivated and lifts the spirit. For example, the great number of football players say that they prefer playng while the stadium is full of fans shoutng out word of encouragement and making supportive posters. That is way watching sports is not a waste of time - you can help your favourite team, or even your country, win.
Secondly, if you are a player too, it is important to watch how you rivals and the world champions play. It can help you create the best strategy for future workouts, for participation in contests and just broaden your horizons of understanding the sport. For instance, the famous professional boxer Mike Tyson often watched games of other boxers for understanding their techniques and weak places. It helped him and now he is a worldclass star. This is the reason why it is essential for people not only play sport, but only watch it.
Thirdly, watching sport can motivetes fans to keep fit. When you see person in a great fit, you want to be like him. There are a lot of examples when people who adore watching games start playing it as an amateur. That is why it is reasonable to watch sports.
To sum up, watching sports cannot be a waste of time. It has a lot of positive consequenses for person such as encouragement of players, self-motivation and getting useful information for your career.
