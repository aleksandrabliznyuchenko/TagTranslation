Today there are people who belived that watching any sport is a useless time spent. I complitely disagree with this opinion. Watching any sort games or individual competition is wonderfull way to spend your free time, by this hobby you can have a lot of profits.
To begin with watching Big sport events such as Olympic Games, Grand Prix and others. The best thing is that humans, beenig hundreds of killometers away from the competition, can still suppory the team or his or her favorite athlete, feel proud of his or her country and his or her involvement in somethig great. Also watching games on TV or at live sport events often motivates people to do their favorite sport themselves.
Moreover, watching sports together also helps you find like-minded people. Often due to the fact that people are fans of same club they became friends for life. Of course, watcing sports can also help people meet their lovers, because a shared hobby is a great Foundation for a long romantic or friendle relationsheep.
Also watching games or competitions in other countries helps fans travel. Often they go abroad to watch their favorite srort and thus watch the world and get unforgettable experience. So thanks watching sports events a person's life became more interesting and diverse.
In conclusion i would like to stress that my point of view is opposite to people who claim that watching any sport is a waste of time. I strongly belive that we get a lot of wanderfull things from watching sports.
