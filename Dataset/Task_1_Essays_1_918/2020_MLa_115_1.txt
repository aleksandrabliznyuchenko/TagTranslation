The bar charts illustrate the changes that occurred in the usage of Facebook over period from 2012 to 2013 and the primary reasons for its' usage among two opposite sexes. Overall, two graphs show the differences in the usage of the network on the devices and the variations in reasoning for its' usage between the genders.
From the first chart it is clear that in only one year the devices from which the Facebook is accessed have changed. While in 2012 the desktop version of the social network was more popular with about 150 millions of users, in 2013 the number has dropped to almost 135 millions. On the other hand, the number of mobile users has increased from about 55 millions of users in 2012 to 95 millions in 2013.
The second chart displays main reasons why men and women use Facebook. The number of men and women who use Facebook for updates is the same at 39%. That is the only part of the graph where the percentages are leveled out, however. Only 39% of men use Fcaebook for sharing photos and videos, with the number climbing to 54% with women, becoming the primary reason for women to use the network. Learning about ways to help others is the least popular reason with only 35% of women and 25% of men choosing. For women seeing funny posts is a second main reason to use the site with 43%, but for men it comes at the third place of choice with only 35%.
