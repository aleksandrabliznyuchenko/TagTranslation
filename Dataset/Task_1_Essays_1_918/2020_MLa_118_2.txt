It's believed that spending time at watching TV sport programmes is not profitable. However, some people say it can develop your skills and techniques. As for me, I suppose that watching sports via TV won't help you become a professional at sport. Moreover, sport events are not very interesting to be seen through television channels.
Well, people say that you can learn a lot from sport programmes. Firstly, as you watch the play, you start to remember all the practice of the best sportsmen in the world. Secondly, if you listen to the words during the recording of the sport event, you learn and repeat the main rules. Besides, you don't have to spend money on the tickets as the translation is free on TV channels. But I disagree with this opinion as watching sport programmes is not a striking thing for me. In addition, tickets are not very expensive. However, it's agreed that you won't become the World champion because of the sitting on the sofa and watching sports on TV. You need to visit a gym, to train a lot and to take part in numerous competitions to catch a success in this sphere. Besides, it's much more attractive to visit the play in the real life than to watch it at home for many reasons. The first reason is that fascinating feelings are provided at the same time you see the players who are not far from you. Also, you can be aware of the everything happening at the stadium. If you watch the sport programme, you can see only those things that the operator wants to record. I agree with this pont of view as I'm fond of visiting plays and competitions in real life. It's a majestic experience to be there.
In conclusion, I' d like to say that sport is an essential part of our life. In my opinion, watching it at home is not as much striking as watching it at the stadium. You need to experience this activity in real life to feel all the dignities.
