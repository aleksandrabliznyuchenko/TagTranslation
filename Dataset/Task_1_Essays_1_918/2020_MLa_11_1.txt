The graph shows comparison of using Facebook in 2012 and in 2013 and the main causes of using it among men and women.
The first graph shows that there is a majority of people who prefer to use Desktop rather than mobile phone. However, there is a clearly seen trend in using mobile phones. Popularity of using social network on mobile phone had grown almost twice from March 2012 to March 2013. On the other hand, number of users who use Facebook on laptop decreased by approximately 20 millions.
The second chart shows the reasons of using Facebook by women and men. The main cause of using social network for both men and women is sharing photos and videos. However, percentage of men who use Facebook is higher, 54 against 39 for women. Receiving updates is another reason, but not so popular as previous one. Almost 40 per cent of men and women prefer to use Facebook in order to receive updates. Seeing funny posts and learning about ways to help others have almost equal percentage of people around 40, but quarter of all men do not consider learning ways to help others as a crucial reason for using Facebook.
