Some people believe that watching any sport events in any variants is a completely useless way to spend your free time. I strongly disagree with this statement.
First of all, watching any kind of tournament or sport competition is granting the observer an enourmous amount of emotions, usually the good ones. The viewer is absolutely astonished by the match, so he can forget about any unpleasant moments, reduce the stress from work or everyday chores. The great happiness, joy and pride overwhelm the football fan when his national team scores a goal in the world championship.
At the same time some people find watching sports not very attractive. The main argument for this point of view is that it is possible to spend free time in a lot of more usefull ways, for example, doing sports on your own. This will help you to get fit and will lead to improvement in your health, while sitting either on your sofa or at the stadium without any physical activities will be only harmful. In addition sport fans often like to eat some unhealthy snacks, for example a pack of chips, and may be even drink a bottle of beer, which is a right way to get some illnesses like obesity.
However i can not fully share this opinion. As i think, watching sport events is encouraging the viewer to start doing sports on their own. The fame of world-known football players encourage millions of children to play with their pals, train and improve their skill, visit sport-schools or fitness centeres. And this statement is true not only about the kids, but teenagers, students and adults as well.
In conclusion of this essay, i would like to say that sport tournaments and championships make our life brighter, fulfill it with the positive emotions and encourage people all over the world doing sports.
