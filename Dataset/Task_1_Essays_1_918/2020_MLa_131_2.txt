Many would agree that rooting fos sports is an important as doing it. First, fans are large global community that brings people together around the world. During the World Cup, many foreign fans came to Russia, this changed the way Russians look at other cultures, helped to become more open. Among other things, it helped to consolidate close friendship around the world. Secondly, it promotes a healthy lifestyle. According to many studies, watching various sports events increases people's views on a healthy lifestyle.
However, despite this, many people believe that watching sports is a waste of time. This is argued by the fact that is often leads to the consuption of junk food and excessive consumption of alcohol, and not as it does not form a healthy outlook on life. I totally agree that watching various sporting events on TV and in stadium is a great way to communicate with people, to form the right outlook on life. For me personally, sport is an integral part of life, I play football with friends and I love watching it with family, so it becomes even more interesting for me to play it.
