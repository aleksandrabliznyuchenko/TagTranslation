There are people, who tend to believe that it is such a waste of time to watch sports events. I disagree with this view. To my mind, watching sports can enhance bonding within communities and promote a healthier lifestyle among individuals.
Watching sport on television or at the stadium is an opportunity for people to come together and cheer for their team. Fans, watching the game together, may have different status in life and they may endorse different religious beliefs or political ideologies. However, when they watch the game, they have only one concern in the world and that is to see their team emerge victorious. Obviously, sporting events bring people closer and help them forget their differences to be the union. When their team wins an international match, it is celebration time for every member of a huge fan union. Sports even ignite patriotic feelings in people.
Community bonding is not the only benefit of watching sports. When people watch their favourite sports stars in action, they feel encourage to keep fit and follow a healthy lifestyle. Needless to say, people who watch sports matches regularly tend to be more active and physically harder. They are also healthier. For instance, a recent study showed that there was a thirty percent increase in the amount of gym attending during the held in 2018 World Football Cup championship. By contrast, watching other television shows or engaging in other activities does not produce this effect. This is because the content is less inspiring and it does not influence motivation to change lifestyle. Thus, it testifies to the fact that watching sports either on TV or at live sports events has a favourable effect on people's tending to do sport and to be healthier.
To sum up, I advocate watching sports is not a waste of time, it may benefit to lifestyle. It promotes stronger bonding within communities and leaves a positive impact on people by encouraging them to purse a healthy way of life.
