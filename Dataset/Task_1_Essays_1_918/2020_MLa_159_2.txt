There is an opinion that spending free time bywatching a sport program on TV or at life sports events is loss of time. I disagree with this point of view. In this essay I will discuss it and give some arguments.
To begin with, watching sports on TV or from tribunes is an opportunity for people to coom together and cheer for their sport team. Funs watching a sport event together and it is good opportunity tj spend some times with each other. Sport teams exhibit a tremendous lever of team spirit that one can apply in one's daily life. Also, while watching the game, we can gain huge knowledge about it. As well, watching sport events offer many benefits that are much needed in every sphere of life. When people watch their favorite sport team or sportsmen, they want to do sport too and want to be healthy. For instance, teenagers want adore their lovely sportperson or sport team. However, watching TV or life sport events does not guarantee that people start to do sport. Foe example, a recent study give us information that there was a 30% increase in gym memberships during the recently heid World Cup Football championship. By contrast, watching other TV or engaging in other activities during leisure time does not produce this effect. This is because the content is less inspiring and it does not motivate people to change their life. To conclude, wathcing sport events is not a waste time. People come together and want to adore their favorite sport person or team. This encourages them to persue a healthy way of life.
