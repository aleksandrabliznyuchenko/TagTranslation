The bar charts illustrate changes in the use of Facebook through the one-year perion from 2012 to 2013.
According to the bar chart numer one, the number of Facebook users decreased by half. It is clear that there is no significant differences between men and women's reasons for using this social net.
It can be seen that in 2012 people used Facebook on the desktop frequently, but in 2013 there is a trend of using facebook on the mobile phone. In 2012 the number of Facebook users with the desktop was 150 million, but on 2013 there are only 55 million.

It can be clearly seen on the figure of sharing photos - women do this 15 per cent more often than men. And the most unpopular reason for using Facebook for everyone is Learning about ways to help others - only 35 per for women and 25 per cent for men.
