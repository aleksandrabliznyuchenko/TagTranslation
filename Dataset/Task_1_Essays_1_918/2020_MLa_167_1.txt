First bar chart illustrates the change in the number of people using Facebook with computers and phones fron March 2012 to March 2013, while second bar chart shows 4 main reasons for men and women to use this social network. Overall, it can be seen that the popularity of using a mobile phone for spending time on Facebook has a positive trend, in contrast to using a computer. Also, on the chart you can see that women use this social network for more reasons than men.
To begin, the total number of Facebook users over the year has almost halved, from about 280 million to 140 million. At the same time, it should be noted that the relative share of users using the phone to spend time on socialnetworks has increased compared to computer users. Thus, in March 2012, there were approximately 150 million purely comnputer users, and 130 million used phones. but a year later the number of computer users dropped to 50 million (the number became less than a third), and the number of people using mobile phones reduced to only 90 million.
Althought the chart with reaons for using Facebook shows the percentage of men and women. It is obnious that women use this social network more, as the percentage among all the reasons is in the lead. It is worth noting that women use Facebook so that share photoes and videos to the greatest extent (54%), and to the least use for learning about ways to help others (35%), among men, interests are distributed approximately the same as among women, but the percentage is less by about 10-15%, depending on the category. Thus, we can conclude that Facebook is generally less ued, more phones are used, and women have more reasons for using it.
