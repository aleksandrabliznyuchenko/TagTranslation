There is a category of people who believe that watching sports events is such a waste of free time, no matter if the fans are watching the match on TV or live. Nowadays, enjoing sports has become one of the common leisure activities - a lot of people are sitting in front of TV and spend all time in one pose. However, some people argue, that it is a waste of time, but my position is that this activity is not a waste time but people have to find a balance between the time spent on watching activities and own sport activity.
Firstly, watching different matches is good fotm to spend time and get positive emotions at the same time. Nowadays, a lot of time is spent on social networks and other empty activity. Therefore, i think that watching sports events is not a bad pastime. For instance, watching matches can form good hobby, as well as create new topic for conversation with friends.
Secondly, watching sports is an excellent and amazing form of entertainment and this is even a passion. It is comfortable way of relaxation for a majority people, also they can find friends among the same fans and socialising. I believe that watching live sports or on TV has become greatest event for communicating between people from many contries. But, spending hours after hours is not recommended for alls.
To conclude, people are wasting a lot of their time already, there is no need to sit out in front of the TV, looking at the activity of other people, you need to take care of your life. But in order to have a good time is an attractive decision.
