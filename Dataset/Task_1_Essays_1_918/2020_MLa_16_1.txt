The provided charts give data on the difference between the number of Facebook users on desktop and mobile in 2012 and 2013 and the most significant purposes men and women use it for.
From the first chart we can clearly state that the number of mobile Facebook users significantly increased in 2013 comparing with 2012. At the same time, the number of desktop users in 2013 was about 20 millions less than in 2012. However, the total number of users both in desktop and mobile saw a huge rise. The main thing we can state from the second chart is that generally both men and women agree that the greatest thing for using Facebook is the possibility to share photos and videos, while the least important one is to find out ways to help others. Still, the opinions deffer when concerning recieving updates and seeing funny posts. While almost the same 39% of both genders claimed that for them getting updates is crucial, only 35% of men against 43% of women took into account seeing funny posts.
