Throughout the history people have had a chance to do a lot of different sports and a chance to be a happy spectator. It all started from the invention of the Olympic Games when somebody participated while others were carefully watching the process. So to someone being a viewer of some type of sport is a waste of time, while others disagree with this. Who is right?
In my humble opinion, watching sports is definately a good way of spending one's leisure time. The major benifit is that people who dedicate their free time to the thing they like are obviously gaining a huge advantage. On the other side doing something you don't like is a much bigger waste of time. That's why if a persone likes to watch some sport, he can do it. Why not? Moreover, watching sports can in turn benifit you in the way of becoming an expert in a specific kind of sport. So it will be possible for you to monitise your expertize on an sport market.
However, there are people who tend to think that sport was invented to take part in it and nothing else. Firstly, people who watch sports all the time and don't practice it simply deteriorate their physical wellbeing. Secondly, those who don't try any sports tend to act like an entitled judges and yell how others should play, run and jump.
To sup everything up, I would like to say that watching sports is fine. Everybody should decide what he or she likes to do without having external pressure. Ultimately a balance between watching sports and doing sports due to being a sports fan is a key to the compromise.
