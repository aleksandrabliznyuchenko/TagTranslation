Watching sports program is very popular nowadays. Some people claim that watching sports events is a waste of time. I can not agree with this, because in my opinion sport is an important part of our life. I explain my point of view below.
First of all, watching sports is a live unforgettable emotion. You can go to a match with friends or family and spend time together. You will be able to get closer to your family and find common interest. For example, because I often went to football with my dad, we become closer. Also at the match you can buy delicious street food, cheer for your team and feel the screams of the crowds of fans. Also, if you watch the match at home you can spend time with your family over a cup of tea and enjoy a quiet evening in.
Secondly, people who watch sports can also become athletes, which can have a positive impact on their health. Thus sports can become their hobby or even the meaning of life. They will start work out eating healthy food and looking good. It seems to me that many children who watched their favorite sports game in childhood will become great athletes in the future. For example, my friend who watched basketball in childhood now plays for the Russian national team.
To sum up, I would like to say that despite the fact that some people think that watching sports is a waste of time, I am convinced of something else, and i proved it in this essay.
