In the 21st century watching sports on TV or at live sport events is a really popular activity for many people. However, some people claim that it does not have enough benefits for us, but I completely disagree with this opinion and think that it can help us to spend our free time really good with our friends or family. Moreover, watching sports is able to unite residents of the country.
First of all, I believe that if you want to spend your holidays with your best friend or your parents, it will be a great idea to go to different football or basketball matches, for example. As for me, It is always fun to shout and whistle with your father when your team scores a goal. i claim that it brings you, your family and friends closer. Moreover, if you have not got a great amount of common interests with someone, i can reccomend such activity to you, because you can chat about sport event with a person for a long period of time. Besides that, i claim that watching sport events people can feel team spirit. They can feel themselves like a part of big country, and it is really wonderful. For example, in 2018 i watched with my family World Football Cup. It was a really great sport event for my country. I think that all residents of Russia watched the match between Russia and Croatia. Althought our team lost the game, i saw that this match allowed people to feel themselves as a team, because everyone supported and comported each other. I think it is really important for every country to have really close-knit residents.
In conclusion, taking everything mentioned into account in our final analysis i can say that watching sport is a really good way of spending your free time. Moreover, it can help the government to unite their residents.
