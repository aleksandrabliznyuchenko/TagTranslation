This assay will discuss that there is people, who believe that watching sports is useless pastime. That problem frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with the supporters maintaining the fact that it is useful. To my mind, watching sport is a great idea of spending your time. It has been already recognized that watching sport is good for health. It develops a logical thinking and concentration. Besides people who watch sport have higher self-esteem and it brings us to the following argument. For example such games as football make people feel the built-in-connection and it has a good impact on mental health of sports fans.
Furthermore, watching sport is a great event to see your friends, relax and take a break from pace of life. It is opportunity to forget about some nervous aspects of life for a while. For example many people fell themselves ecstatic when they spend their time watching sports with friend or family. Nowadays some families have not enough common interest to spent some time together, but sport could interest anyone, even the youngest members of it. Although not all of them will be interested in the end result, but spending time around the same table is still important anyways.
Although, it must be said that there is no absolute "right" attitude to this spending of time and everyone has the right to make a decision for themselves: watch sports or not. But I couldn't agree more that it is a fun and useful to do that, especially with friends and family.
