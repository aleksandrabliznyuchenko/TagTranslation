Watching sports is a popular way to relax for lots of people. There is an opinion that this way of spending time is totally useless for the individual. Personally, I disagree this statement. In this essay I would try to explain my opinion and discuss the opposite one.
I believe you can improve yourself by watching sports. On the one hand, it can motivate you to do training. For example, your favorite skater may inspire you to start doing sports to become more like him. On the other hand, you watch how professional sportsmen do physical excersizes. You may learn a huge ammount of things from them and correct your own mistakes while doing same sports. Many boys learn how to play football by watching games of the famous football players on TV.
Although, I can understand some arguments of the opposite side. First, most part of the sport fanats doesn't do the same sport as they watch on TV. They eat bad food and drink beer while watching and just waste their precious time when they could, for example, do training themselves. Second, some fanats pay too much money for sport events. What is the reason to give a month wage for sitting at the top the huge trubune far away from the arena and watching same TV screen as you could watch at home?
To sum up, I would like to say that I'm sure that watching sports can become a brilliant hobby if you watch it not only for having thought-less rest, but also use for self-improvement.
