nowadays, we do not have enought free time. Someoone think, that spend this time by watching particular sport is just useless for you. As for me, i disagree with this statmen? becouse it has some benefites for us.
First of all, i think, that watching sports on TV or at live sports events is imortant for team spirit. jusr imagine you are with unkknown people, but you feel the general atmosphere of unity and can find new friends, when you go on the stadium match or watching in pub. In my opinion, this is a good idea, when you watching sports with our loved ones, becouse you can spend time together and ceering together for our favorite team.
Secondly, some people take inspiration when watching sport games. For example, my friend Andrew really like bascetball and NBA players has a big influense on him, so he choose sport for future career. Now he had workout everyday and went to goal without missing NBA game. He is a good player in Moskow now. It is an instance how watching sports influence on our future plans. So it is imortant to understand, that now sports have right infuense for teenagers.
In conclusion, watching sports in free time is a good way to relax, spend timewith friends or family. Sport is a good lever od pressure for actions.
