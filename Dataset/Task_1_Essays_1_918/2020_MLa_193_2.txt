There is a statement that having such hobby as watching sport is fully useless. In my point of view spending leisure time by watching sport is a great way of entertainment, so i disagree with that topic.
First of all, watching sport on tv is making people relaxing, for instance, after a hard working day. They experience incredible emotions after seeing that their favourite team won. As an example, in Lithuania there is a national sport-basketball, so many families meet up at dinner and watch the show. They are rejoicing and worring about basketballers, such activities unite families and the citizens of the whole country. Sports are providing patrotism and unity.
Secondly, watching sport inspires people to do sport one day. According to me, looking after Petersburg's football team Zenit, I've started doing that sport as a hobby with my collegues, and we have decided to make our own football team. Moreover, I am becoming much more healthier after each training and match, so my immune sistem has rised since i have started playing football. Now i am looking much more better and I am in a better shape To sum up my reasonings, i would like to say that each leisure time spending can't be called "wasting time", because every single man is choosing what he/she loves. Talking about sport, it is exciting cheering on the sport team or just watching sport for relaxing, so as I said sport unites people all over the world and can inspire for living healthier life.
