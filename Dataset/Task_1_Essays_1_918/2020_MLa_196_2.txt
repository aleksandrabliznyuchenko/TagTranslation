Nowadays there are two points of view on the problem of watching sport games. Some people believe that it is a waste of time and people can do something more effective instead of this. Others believe, that people can watch it and be happy and effective. In my opinion, there is no negative effect, when people watch programs, which they prefer.
First of all, when you love sport and watch sport games on TV or at live sport events, you have unfogetable emotions. The best example is the situation when man, who love football very much, watch the match on TV: he can cry, scream, jump. Thats all natural emotions of the fan of the football. They do not waste the time, they spend their time with pleasure. Moreover, they can be effective before and after the game.
Secondly, watching sport can be useful for some persons. Sportive people, who do it professional, can watch game to gain experience and skills. For example, girl from professional dancing club watch dance competition on the Internet to develop her abilities and to know something new.
Thirdly, every person have a hobby. Some people like to watch serials and films, others prefer reading books. It seems to me that we do not call people's hobby ''waste of time''. For example, a part of the people like to watch music competiton on TV in their free time. People can not say, that this group is not effective, because it is their decision, how pass their free time. The same thing with the sport games, for some people it is hobby and a big part of the life. As a result, I should say, that watching sport games on TV or at live events have not negative effect on your effectiveness, because people should do what they want to do in their free time. If this help them to feel something wonderful, I think, they can watch their favourite sport games without any doubts.
