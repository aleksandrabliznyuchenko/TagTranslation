It is often said that watching sport programes on TV is uselessly. There are a lot of people who agree to this point of view, telling that watching cports is not educating way to spend your time, but there are others who think that is impotant to watch football matches or athletics on TV and I agree with them.
Watching sports is not the waste of time for some reasons. First of all, watching on TV how people do different sports can attract people do the same activity. For instance, the win of the favourite football team can awaken the desire the children to go to the football clsses or the shape of some athelets can make some people to lose some weight. Moreover, in my opinion watching stort vidios are more helpful for people than watching funny videos about cats or something else on the Internet. While you are watching sports you wonder abot the resulst of the famouse sportsmen or your country on different championships.
Another point of view, how I think, is based on lack of aducatiional tools of watching sport programes. It is somewhat true that people should spend their free time with the benefit. Nevertheless, they should always search for new information and improve their skills. They also claim that those who watch spots are always do it with the unhealthy food and drinks, so they harm their health.
To sum up, I partly agree that watching sports a lot sometimes can lead to the waste of time, but as far as I am concerened, if you will follow the trend of watching sports to support the team or a sportsmen or, it would not be a waste of time. Moreover, you can do sports duaring wathing TV programmes.
