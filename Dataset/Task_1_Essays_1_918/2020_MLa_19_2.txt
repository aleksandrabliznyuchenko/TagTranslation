Nowadays there is an opinion that watching sport is a bad thing because it wasted time. I agree with this opinion and think that people should not watching sports events and with help a few examples I will explain my point of view.
Firstly, watching sports for a long time is inhealthy. Most of the sporting activities last for several hours, during which the person sits motionless on an armchair or sofa. It is very bad for health. This can lead to diseases such as back pain, hemorrhoids, obesity. For example, my grandfather was a very big footbal fan. He watched matches every day. THis lead to the fact that his legs constantly hurt and by the age of 50 he practically could not walk.
Secondly, watching sports events for a long time becomes a kind of drug that more and more deprives us of time. Every day there are more and more sports broadcasts and ultimately people spend most of their time watching these events. They waste their lives, achieve nothing and suffer because of it. I have many examples from my personal life of how my friends get hooked on wathing sports events. As a result, they have no money, no job, no privacy life, they are depressed all the time. In conclusion, watching sports event badly affects on a personal's life, because a person has such problems as healt problems, lack of work, lack of privacy.
