Some people think that watching sport (EITHER ON TV OR AT LIVE EVENTS) is a waste of time. Lets go to discus about this!
There are many arguments for this opinion. At first watching sport spends a lot of time, for example football match goes for 90 minutes. It is good argument, because in modern world we dont have much free time. Secondly watching sports is boring for many people, i want to say that watching sport for people who do not like sport is waste of time. Besides, some people who like to go sport doesnt watching sport on tv, they have opinion that professional sport is not good idea and they dont want to be part of this. They think that play sports more interesting than watching sport.
From another hand, there are many people who have polar opinion. Some people like to watching sport because they are big fans of some sport team, they involves in special subculture and watching matches their favourite team is a part of their lifes. It take for him great emotions which they cant find in ordinary life. Some people who like play sport like watching them too. Because they want to see and research difference of they and professional sportsmen.
I cant agree with this positon. I think that watching sport is a great way to take great emotions and take off stress. Specialy good to see game in stadium, there are is wonderfull atmosfer. Watching sport is good for relax from dificults of ordinary life.
