Nowadays there are many people who are strongly belive that watching sports is an unwise timespending. There might be many reasons for that position which can trigger people with such view. However, I am on the other side in this discussion. To my mind visiting sports events or watching it on TV is a nice recreational activity.
Firstly, sport is a huge part of culture in many countries all around the world so people are really into sports activities and of course into big sports events such as Olimpic Games. This kind of a sports event help people from different parts of Earth communicate face to face than they visit games. Moreover, people who just watch Olimpic Games on TV also feel like a part of a community of supporters, because everyone who is watching care about their country to win and makes us connected.
The other reason not as significant as the previous one but it is also crucial for the society. The thing is that kids need to be keen on sports from the young age as if they know more about sports, they leade a healthier lifestile. It is vital for us as parents to penetrate phisical activities into daily routine of a child in order to grow useful habits which will be significant in adult life. In order to reach such goal we should not only do sports but also show the example of other people who are successful in this field so watching sports is important additional activitie.
To owerview I am confident in my position that watching sports is an useful and interesting way to invest your time. It is based on two main reasons communication and growing up useful habits which both are crucial for development of society.
