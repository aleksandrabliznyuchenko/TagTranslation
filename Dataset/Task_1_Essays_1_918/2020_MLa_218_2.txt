In the modern world people are captured by busy lives with travelling, career building and families. Some of them firmly believe that there is no place to TV or live sport events in their lives because it is time wasting. Let us examine the reasons for this position.
The first argument to the opinion of the pointlessness of watching such events is that sport itself is created for health development. For instance, the football is more than just a team game. It also provides body with stamina, helps our heart to work more excessively and teaches to choose suitable strategies during the process. According to this view, if people are interested in the particular sport, they should be part of it as a player. Moreover, modern trend is to develop in the intellectual sphere involving general level of education, career and the worldview. In this case sport can be seen as activity opposite to intellectual growth. For example, it makes more value to read scientific research than watch sport events.
However, sport events demonstrate the rise of patriotism. To illustrate this idea we can imagine an ordinary international football match where people support country's teams using banners, special words, videos and wearing clothes with the slogan of the playing team. All these actions associate people with the teams, thus, attach them to the nation stronger.
To sum up, all the types of activities can be both valuable and useless depending on the final result they give. In this way I believe that watching sport events is not waste of time if it provides people with moral and physical development, gives confidence or just gives an opportunity to unwind.
