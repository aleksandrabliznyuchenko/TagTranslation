A lot of people think, that it is waste of time to go to sports events or watch translations of it. In my opinion, it is not true for some reasons.
First of all, most of people go to such events to cheer for favorite team. Sometimes it helps them to feel happy and feel they are part of something huge. Also you don't usually go to sport events alone, so it's great ability to meet you friends. Of course, if someone watches, for example, football on TV, he always can invite his friend to do it together and have a nice evening.
On the other hands, watching sports events rare trigger agression to another people, and it couses fightings or just disputes after matches. Also you can take only emotions from this events, and, of course, you can do something useful at this time. In conclusion, I can say that sport events unite people, and it is very important sometimes be happy with someone.
