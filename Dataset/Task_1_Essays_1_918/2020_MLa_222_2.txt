There is an opinion that watching sports events is a meaningless way of spending one's time. I would disagree with this point of view since there might be some justifiable exceptions.
I do believe that sometimes watching sports events might be quite useful. The first obvious reason is when people consider such activivity as a good opportunity to spend their spare time and relax a bit. After all, when watching a brilliant and dynamic tennis game between Rodger Federer and Federich Nadal in a company of your close friends became such a crime. Moreover, some people might need to track such events closely because it coincides with their proffessional interests. For example, a beginning athelte can get a lot by watching sports played by masters in their field. In addition, these events may inspire more youngsters to do exercise and have a healthy lifestyle. I do not think that this is completely irrevelant, given how many children are dealing with obesity problems nowadays.
To sum it up, sometimes watching sports events or life broadcasts may be quite profitable way (whether directly or indirectly) to invest in someone's time. And let the people who say the opposite queitly enjoy their favorite activities without harming others' feelings.
