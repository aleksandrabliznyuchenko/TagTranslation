Currently, watching sports is rated as one of the most popular activity of pastime. However, it is argued by some that it is worthless to spend time watching sports channels and visiting sports events. I completely agree with this opinion and in this essay I will state the reasons for my view.
First of all, the main reason why I think that watching sports is a useless activity is that it does not provide you with any practical skills. Most likely, people spend time sitting and eating junk food while watching sports both at home and at the stadium. Thus, this amusement does not make them stronger or more resilient. I believe that it is better to do those things that can be beneficial for their minds or bodies, such as going to the gym, reading or taking part in sport competitions by themselves.
Another reason for my position is possible appearance of addiction. Long viewing of sports can make a person a real fan so he will not be able to tear himself away from his favourite business. Personally, I think that it can lead to large expenses. For instance, nowadays each competition like World Championship or Olympiad has its own branded products. As fans, people start buing expensive T-shirts or balls with athletes' signatures. I believe that it is a rather negative consequence of watching sports.
Admittedly, watching sports is not always useless activity so there are some positive sides of this pastime. Some people can be inspired by stong sportsmen that they saw on TV or during the sport event. Consequently, that can make them start their own sport career. Also, it is really beneficial for national athletes to watch sports events for understanding different strategies of their competitors.
In conclusion, I totally agree with the opinion that watching sports is just a waste of time. Despite the fact that there are some advantages that sport viewing gives to beginning and professional sportsmen the cons outweight the pros.
