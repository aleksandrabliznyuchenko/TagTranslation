Nobody will deny that sport is an essential part of our everyday life. Nowadays some people claim that there is no need in live sports events or TV programms which are related to sport. To my point of view this statement is false and I totally believe that people should watch sports both on television and at live sports events.
The first thing I would like to consider is that there is a large number of people who likes sport and appreciate watching different sports shows. Unfortunatelly, not every persom is a sportsman due to different reason such as illness or health and physical abilities. But such problems do not mean that a person do not want to be a part of this world, therefore such people enjoy watching live sports events and TV programms.
The main positive side of this issue is that when people watch sports it makes them more motivated. Thus process happened because people have an example of self-made people who hardly worked to reach a success. Moreover, according to scientific research children and teenagers who used to watch live sports events could easily achieve their goals in future life. Another argument in favour is that sports programms help peolple who are interested in sport to know more about different types of sport and sportsman's life. In addition, people could also improve their skills and knowledge during watching sports on TV as well as at live sports events. In other words it is much more easier to understand how things happen in practical rather than in therory. That is why sport's trainers give an advice to watch sports shows instead reading books.
Taking everything into account I can say that watching sports is not a waste of time. Moreover, this issue has a lot of benefits and for this reason I truely believe that people should watch sports TV programms as well as live sports events.
