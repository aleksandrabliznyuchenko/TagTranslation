Nowadays sport and helthy lifestyle becomes more and more popular, so nothing extraodinary about that TV and live sports envents have a same tendetion. But while ones consider that it is great way for timespending, anothers believe that watching sports is a waste of time and i partly agree with them.
In one hand, if you do it for fun and relaxation there is nothing wrong with watching sports. In this perspective there is nothing different between watching sports and visiting cinema or theater. There are a lot of activity connected with watching sports: Support your favoirate team on sport events or relax with your friends in sport bar. Everyone can choose the way to rest and chillout like they want and there is nothing wrong with it.
On another hand, many people say that its usefull to watching sports you can get knowelege watching the game of masters. But from practiacal point this way of learning is quite useless thing to do, cause if you want to improve your sport skills you have to stand up, overcome your fears, laziness, go on the field or gym practice and practice till your bones collapse because thats the only way to success.
In conclusion, in my opinion there are two aproximatelly equal points of view: If you want to improve youreslf then watching sports is a waste of time, and if watching sports if your way for relaxation then where is nothing wrong with it. But in my case i really like to do sport exercises and the statment connected with selfimprovement closer to me.
