Nowadays there are a lot of sports chanells on TV. Live sports events have a big meaning in people's lives. But there is the opinion that watching sports doesn't cost the time. I completely disagree with this opinion. To my mind, watching sports is important for us ourselves, our families and our countries.
First of all, watching sports helps people to feel united inside the countries and to feel themselves like a one nation. The strongest argument is that when people from one country watch a match where their national team fights for the first place, they always feel like a one big family. People watch important matches together at homes, at bars or even at streets. They are getting nervous, happy or angry together at the same time. And i think that it is wonderful and it helps people inside countries to feel connection between each other.
Secondly, watching sports is kind of relax. After a hard work day a lot of people like to watch sports. Even if you aren't doing sports and have never done it professionally, something in sports keeps our attention to it. I believe that it helps people to feel relaxing and to forget about problems in their lives.
Taking everything i have said into consideration, I am sure that watching sports is not a waste of time. TV sports streams or live sports events are the reasons of people feeling united into the countries and relaxed after work days.
