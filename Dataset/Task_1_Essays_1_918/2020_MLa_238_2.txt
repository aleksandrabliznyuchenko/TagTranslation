Sport is one of the most significant parts of our every-day life. Some people tend to think that it is totaly waste of time to watch sport on the TV. I totally dissagree with this opinion. From my point of view, watching diffrent kinds of sport activity can provide children and adults with positive and healthy lifestyle. Besides, watching sport with friends in front of TV can be a good idea for gathering together.
First of all, most of people nowdays are very busy working, studying and doing house work. In order to be relaxed and have fun they choose TV. Moreover, visiting live sport events can be very expensive. Not every family or student can allowed to spent thousands of dollars or rubbles for watching famouse football team. It important to mention that not each sport event can bring you good mood and positive emotions. In most cases people who came to watch the game have high expectations and if team loses it can be very upsetting and dissapointing.
Nevertheless, i would like to stress that watching sport events on the TV can be rather boring and monotonous. However, it is always more interesting to go out and meet new people, communicate with them and improve your social life. Furthemore, when your are watching game at the stadium it is absolutely another energy and feelings. Because you can see sportsmen and gamers who feel support and interest to the game from visitors.
In conclusion, i would like to emphasize that both opinions have strong support. But sometimes it is more comfortable and easier to watch sport on the TV. It is a good idea especially for people with health peoblems, disease and other reasons which can't allowed to visit live game or sport event. Everybody chould choose which way of watching sport is more available for him. So that, i absolutely agree with opinion that TV sport events are not waste of time.
