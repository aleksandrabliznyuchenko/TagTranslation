All people have hobbies. Some like active sports, some not. A lot of people enjoy wathing sport (on a TV or at live sports events). However, some people think it is just a waste of time. I strongly believe that wathing sports is useless. Firstly, i would like to say that doing sport by yourself is funnier and makes you a lot happier. When you play footbal, for example, you can enjoy every moment on field, you can fully understand the drama of the match and feel all the emotions from the game. Secondly, doing sport by yourself is better for your physical health. Scientists say that even half an our of jogging every week will make your heart work more stable and reduse your headaches.
Besides that, there are people who say watching sport on TV is better because you can see some details which is impossible to see while doing sport by yourself. Without a doubt, being a spectator is easier and makes you use less energy comparing to partisipating some activity. If someone just want to rest after a hard day, wathcing sport may be the only chance to partisipate it. I can't agree with this opinion because you can do the sport you like in every time and feel better after doing it.
In conclusion i would like to say that watching sport has both pros and cons, but i think that doing sport by yourself is the best way to enjoy the process and feel all the emotions which it can give you.
