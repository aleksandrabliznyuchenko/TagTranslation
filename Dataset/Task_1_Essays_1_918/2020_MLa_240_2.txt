Many people believe that watching sports on TV as well as visiting live sports events is a waste of personal time. I totally agree with the statement as the time spent watching other people play sports can be devoted to personal development and family.
Firstly, the time is money. While some people are spending hours watching sport sitting on a coach or visiting sport event, others work and grind to approach their goals. The standart sports game lasts more than one hour. This time can be eather spent on the development of your physical abilities or mental training. If every person had spent one hour reading or doing sports instead of wasting time on watching it, there were less obesity issues as well as the cases of mental deseases.
Secondly, this time can be devoted to family. There are a lot of examples of children and elder people feeling lonely and craving for attention. As a result, children can become a members of deliquent groups and start consuming drugs or alcohol, while elder people can become a target to various mental issues. Quality time with family that includes holidays spent together and conversations can prevent many bad outcomes concerning family.
To sum up, I hardly believe that watching sports on TV or attending live sports events is a good idea because this time can be spent in a wise way as developing personal skills and abilities and maintaining warm relationships with your family members.
