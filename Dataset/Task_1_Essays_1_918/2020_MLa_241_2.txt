It is common knowledge that watching sports is unnessesary useless thing that killing your time. Many people all over the world are fond of watching diferent sports games, championships and olimpic games. This is one of the oldest intertaimaned. First olimpic games was in acient Greece and it was the reason for athlets from every coner of empire to come and show their strength. Nowadays every country has profetional sportsmens in different sports and you do not need to go to Greece to watch the competitions.
Everybody has even once watched some sports on TV or at live events. It is more popular among man, but females like watching sports too. They say that it feels like you are one of the team members and you playing with them. This feeling help you to feel stronger and more confident.
Someone feels bad about watching sports and can unterstand it. It feels like wasting time for them. In my opinion, such people just do not have empathy to feel your yourself as part of something bigger than your family. This people believe that sports will be the the same without fans, but they are wrong. All the sports are performances for usual people and this is the main part of the magic of competitions.
Personaly i am the biggest hockey fan and fond of going on games, because this feelig on the stadium near people shouting and applousing their idols is the best time of the life. You take so many positive emotions from this crazy crowd, that you would probably want to feel this again.
