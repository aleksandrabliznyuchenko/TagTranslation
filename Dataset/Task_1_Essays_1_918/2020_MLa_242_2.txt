Nowadays, a lot of people think that you do not need to spend your time watching sports while others argue that watching sports is a good idea. I personally believe that there is nothing bad when people watch their favourite sports on TV or at live. In this essay we will discuss both views on this topic.
Some people claim that you need to watch your favourite kind of sports on TV or go to different sports events because it can motivate you. When you look at your favourite sportsmen and see how successful and motivated they are, you start getting motivation from them. You see their success and want to reach the same, that is how motivation works. For instance, i am a tennis player and i always go to tennis tournaments to watch how famous tennis players enjoy what they do and how fascinating they play. After that, i always want to work hard and do more for my personal success.
There are people who do not find watching sports is a good idea because they think that people can spend this time doing sport by themselves and it will be more useful. They are sure that doing something for your personal body and health is better than just watch how other people make themselves better. For example, do not sit right after televison, just go to the fitness centre instead. I personally disagree with that because when you watch sports on TV or at live sports events, you see how sportsmen play/do sports and you can use it for your personal aims. For instance, you can remember some useful exercises and include them later in your training plan or take a look on the technics of exercises.
To coclude, different people have different tastes. Some people think that it can be useful to watch sports on TV or at live, while others claim that it is a waste of time. As for me, i agree with the first point of view.
