It is often argued by a lot of people that watching sport events on TV or live is just a waste of time. There can be several opinions on this matter that may prove if it is true or not. I personally do not agree with this opinion.
In my point of view, watching sports is not a waste of time. This kind of activities can have a positive effect on people's lives.
First of all, people are able to let their negative emotions out of their chest whilst watching some sport game after a hard work day. Moreover, they don't hurt their families' feelings by being rude to them or even yelling at them. After all viewer gets a relief and calms down.
Second of all, we should all admit that we have various hobbies that are not always useful and productive. Nevertheless, we all need our own spare time to do what we like even if it seems highly irrational to other people. Thus, we can not judge anyone's favourite activities. If we are not able to find an activity that makes our lives better, we will not be happy at all.
To sum up, I would like to point out that watching any kind of sport events on TV, on the Internet, or live is not a waste of time. It can affect people's lives in a positive way.
