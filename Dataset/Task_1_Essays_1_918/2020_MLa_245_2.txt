Nowadays sport is a national priority and all sport events are usually on TV channels or live on big sport arenas. Many people think that watching sports events is a waste of time. On the other hand, there are people who think it can be really useful.
As for me, I am not an active person, so I do not play any sports or do fitness. I prefer walking in the woods or just laying and watching some TV-shows. But when it comes to national competitions or the Olympic games in different categories, I enjoy watching it, as it is really heartfelt to me. To this day I have never been on a live sport event but i would love to be there one day. Moreover, it can help people to become more educated in some ways. Maybe people who are professionals can lean some new tactics for the games, or people watch sports to find a hobby for themselves and then do sports in real life. Even sometimes watching sports can be profitable as people can make perhaps on the winner and make some money.
To sum up, I would like to say that watching sports cannot be a waste of time. It is always fun, exiting or even profitable.
