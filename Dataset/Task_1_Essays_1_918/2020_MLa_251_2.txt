There is an opinion, that people, who spend their free time watching sports, spend it just for free, without any benefits. I totally disagree with this opinion, because I find lots of pluses in watching sports.
First of all, some people do not have a chance to take part in real game. There are many reasons for that, such as illnesses, job or age. watching games, for example on TV, gives such people a chance to participate in a game and experience different emotions, like drive, excitement and joy. In our daily life it is really hard to experience such feelings. Watcing sports also teach people to work in a tem, when we talk about team kinds of sport, such as football.
for people, who are active athletes, watching sport games in their leisure time is really good, because it helps them to see different mistakes of other sportsmen and do not repeat them in their matches. Also, even during the training process, some trainees show sportsmen videos of different games as an examples of how to do or not to do.
To conclude, there are really good points to spend your free time in these way. i think, that watching sports is much better for people of all ages thanwatcing, for example reality shows, because sports help us to develope our mind. In addition, some kids start doing sport after wanching it on TV or in the Internet.
