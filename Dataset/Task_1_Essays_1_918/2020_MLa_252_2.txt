In the mind of some people the idea of seeing sport games in reality or on television takes too much time for nothing. They say that people could spend their precious resource differently: studying or even doing sports on your own. I cannot agree with this opinion because I think that nowadays sport become an integrated element in our society and become a motivation for young people and even for professionals.
To say primarly, watching sport events can make a certain person feel greater than doing other activities. It may give him/her the sense of a participancy to something bigger than he or she is. Basically seeing sport in different variants, communications with other fans, emotions and adrenaline which comes during the watching process can better the actual need than reading a book, learning languages, etc.
Moreover, sport programmes and events become a motivation for ones who only begin a career in sport and even for proffesionals. A liitle kid you saw sport activities on TV or in reality can awaken a desire to try it. Probably it could become a destiny of the child: a lot o sprortsmen of a global scale started their caree in the very similiar way. One more point is that even proffesionals who stopped doing sport for a reason can remember the sense which gives the involvement and decide to repeat that experience starting on their own or motivating others.
The other argument is that people who cannot do sport for the reason of bad health can become a part of this community because of the availability of watching sports on television or visiting special events.
Thus, for some people watching sport games can become a chance to realize their needs or even destiny.
