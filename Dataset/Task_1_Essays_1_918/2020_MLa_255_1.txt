Overall, the general trend is women use Facebook more then men in percentage terms. Turning to details, more than half of women use Facebook to share photos and videos, which accounts for 54 percent. Additionally, the second most used feature for women is seeing funny posts, which accounts for 43 percent. Also, men are more likely to use the functions of Facebook such as sharing photos and videos or receiving updates. Least of all men use Facebook for learning about ways to help others, which is half of 100 percent. In equal percentages, men and women use Facebook to receive updates, which amount for 39 percent.
