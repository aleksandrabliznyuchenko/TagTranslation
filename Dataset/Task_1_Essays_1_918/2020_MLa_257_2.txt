Certain part of people consider it unnecessary to watch sports channels or go to the sports matches. For real there are many points of view in society but i have to disagree with this state.
No doubt when people watch football or race, for example, they do not make money or contribute in any way by their actions. However, no one should forbid people to use their free time as they like. Watching sports events is a good pastime for many people, along with cooking and cycling. It always cheers up, adrenaline is produced and most part of people feel happy watching such events.
Of cource, it is crucial to find a balance between normal watching of sports channels and dedicating all your time to this thing. Nevertheless this topic talks about watching sports in general so no one can say that it is the waste of the time because it will be choice discrimination for freetime. No one says that cucling is waste of the time, right? The same cannot be sad that watching sports on TV or at live sports events is bad or incorrect.
I would to conclude with statment that I also like watching sports channels and like to go to the football match. I love this things and nobody can say me that it is wrong.
