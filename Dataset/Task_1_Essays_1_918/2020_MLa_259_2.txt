Our world now is fulled with entertaiment. For example, sports events. One might think that watching other people play with a ball or other physical activities is a waste of time, but I beg to differ and here is why.
First and foremost, I myself play basketball. I love this sport becuase of its fast pace, constant motion and unbelievable plays from time to time. It just exciting to watch professional athletes like in the NBA. But it is not just about being a fan of the game but also being a student of it. By watching iconic players and games you are learning new moves and tactics which could be helpful. For example, I like to use a one of the Kyrie Irving's dribbles and it often helps me to pass a defender. Also my team uses one of the variants of the pick-and-roll play that our coach saw once.
And talking about teams. Sports events are meant to be shared with other people. It is a nice way to spend time together and build bonds. Watching biothlon is a long-time tradition in my family. It is also worth to mention such exciting events as the FIFA World Cup which are not solely about football but also about uniting nations with the help of the game. Moments like these create memories and friendships which could last forever.
So the statement that watching sports event is pointless depends on whether you are a fan or not. Some pople might like it, some not, which is totally normal and makes us human.
