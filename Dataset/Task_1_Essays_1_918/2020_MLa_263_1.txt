The line graphs show changes in connected devices and reasons why people use Facebook.
Over all, there is a different number of users in 2012 and 2013 year. Moreover, as we can see, on Facebook there are more active women that men.
The number of accounts who use desktop fell in comparison with 2013 year. However, mobile users went up significantly by 40 million users in 2013 year. Throughout the period the number of mobile users increased. Then using desktop slowly decreased and in general remained stable and without huge changing.
It can be considered from the second graph, that women use social networks for sharing media more than men. The percents of sharing photo and video women users partially more by 15%. So the main part of women use Facebook for that reason.
