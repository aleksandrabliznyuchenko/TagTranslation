Nowadays sport has become less popular tman in the past. Watching sports either online or offline can even be charaterized as the waste of time. I can parly agree withm this statement.
To begin with, attending sport events can be a really helpfull to meet someone new or to learn new mates or colleages better. In ancient Greece all wars were stopped dring the period of olympic games. In this way sports events can be seen as a perfect instrument to deescalate conflicts. People who are having hard times can invite each other to watch live sport event and become firends. For example, a friend of mine has even found a relationships on a football game! They just saw each other across the field and fell in love at the firt sign.
On the other hand, it can be useless for someone to watch sport events on the television. People just cannot find any pleasure in it. There is no point to watch how people run back and forward on your screen. During the time off a baseball game whcih is three hours long one can do a lot of things such as reading, walking, spending time with family or even do sports him or herself!
In conclusion, watching sports live can be very exciting, while someone can find watching it on TV dull and useless. It is better to find what a person prefers more. I can recomend the one who dislike watching sports live trying going out on a match with friends and see if it can be a spectacular action.
