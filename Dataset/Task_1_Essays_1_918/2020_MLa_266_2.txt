Nowadays the problem of necessity of watching sports is widely discussed. While some people believe that attending sports events and the watch of sport shows are important in somebody's life others claim that this kind of activity is not helpful and people do not need to waste time on this. This essay will discuss the benefits of watching sports.
Personally, I disagree with the opinion of helplessness of watching sports. First of all, this activity is people's king of hobby. As it known, people need hobby in their spare time to relax and get pleasure. In the routine life people have a lot of stress and watching sports helps to relieve it and forget about their problems.
Secondly, watching sports is the important hobby because while sport lovers watch tournirs in bars or in stadiums they can discuss sport with unknown people and then become friends in the future. Watching sports helps people to develop their social life. Thirdly, watching sports is very asart activity and the lovers of sport have an ability to get adrenaline which all people need sometimes. Futhermore, after attending matches or tournirs some people probably think about doing sports by themselves because they want to be as strong as their favourite sportsmen. Watching sports can help to grow up the healthy nation.
In conclusion, there are many advantages of watching sports on TV or at live sports events. Although some people suppose that this kind of activity is useless I believe that watching sports has the possibility to make lifes of people better. They find friends, cope with the stress and make their bodies healthy and strong.
