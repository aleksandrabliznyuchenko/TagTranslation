Some people believe that watching sports in real life or in TV programmes is stupid spending of time. It is a difficult question and I understand that idea, but I know that watching sports is real important for sports fans. So, I can not agree or disagree with this statement and I want to say about my opinion.
One of the principle advantages of watching sports is possibikity to feel great atmosphere of competiton. People want to get emotions of viewing the sport activity and feel energy of sports players. In adiction, when you come at the stadium you can see many thousands of such people, that like sports as you. Futhermore, when people watch sports, they have a vision how people can improve their sport skills. In this way, for example, you can see sports game at home with you child and motivate him to improve his skills in sports and become such famous person like others.
On the other hand, some people consider that watching sports is waste of time, because when you see the game you do not develop in something. For instance, it would be much more helpfull for youself if you decide to spend this time for your sports exiercises or workout. Moreover all sports indusrtry is a business, where clubs owners and players earn a big amount of money from their contracts. In this way, sometimes they don't think about theit fans and spectators and only to earn more money.
To conclude, in my pesrpective watching sports in real life and also watching it in TV programmes have both advantages and disadvantages. I think that each person should decide this question for himself, but I understand and support both of views.
