According to some people, spending time by watching sports programs are useless, because you squander your free time. However, I agree with this view. In my opinion, instead of watching TV or live sports events you can read the book and engage in self-development.
Firstly, sports programs give you nothing but relaxation. There are many other relaxation options, that can also help you relieve stress or learn new things. Much better to read a good interesting book and at the same time increase your vocabulary and practice imagination. Also you can try your hand in creativity or take a walk in the forest. My brother loves to watch sports programs and nothing else, so he can not put two words together.
Secondly, one of the problem of those who constantly watch sport is obesity. And obesity can cause diabetes or heart attack. Studies have shown that people often eat a lot when watching sports programs. At stadiums always fast food is sold. They also just need to look at someone who, for example, plays football, but not to play themselves. This makes them inactive and indolent. When I was at school, my classmate liked to watch football and eat chips. He became more lazy and gained weight.
In conclusion, people of all ages should not waste their time by watching sports, instead of doing some more useful activities. People need to read more, be creative and walk with friends or alone, to not to get obese and get stupid.
