Nowadays watching TV and watching sports seems to be a popular leisure. Nevertheless, many people have an opinion that watching sports on the TV is a waste of time. Let us find out if it is right or wrong.
In the present time digital technologies are moving forward. Watching sports is a good example of the development of technologies for the past 50 years. I guess, in the 1970-s fans of sports were also considering watching matches only at the stadiums. Nevertheless, the coronavirus has dramatically changed the situation in the world, and watching sports offline is not available till the end of pandemic alert. Watching sports on the TV is a good solution when a match cannot be watched offline because of taking place in another country, or because of expensiveness of the tickets.
Some of those who love sports and do physical activities will say that watching sports on TV is a waste of time. The people who love sports usually prefer doing it instead of watching it. They believe that any physical activity, even a walk in the park, might help feel better. Moreover, we should remember that doing any sports produces the hormones of happiness. I agree with this opinion. Nothing can replace doing sports, even watching it. Watching a match or playing a it at the gaming console cannot replace doing the same in real life and I agree with this opinion.
Summing up all the opinions, I want to say that it is nod bad to watch sports, but making it constantly without a purpose instead of physical activity might not only waste time, but even ruin a life.
