Watching sports is one of the way to spend our free time so many people often do it either on TV or at live sports events, but other people think that it is only a waste of time. I agree with the position that watching sports is a waste of time that is why I would like to prove it.
I think that watching sports is a waste of time because while watching sports you do not do anything, it is the passive way of spending our free time that is why I do not like it at first. Secondly, while watching sports on TV it also can harm your health because different competitions or matches can be continued for a long time, this can cause that your eyes will be sick. Apart from these, I think that in our free time we need to do something active or interactive to improve our skills and personal qualities.
On the other hand, there are people who think that watching sports is an interesting way to spend time. Most of these people prefer watching sports because there are the fans of some kinds of sports, they like these sports so much that is why watching sports for them is the most favourite way to spend their free time. Also, maybe these people used to do some kind of sport and now they prefer to watch it.
To sum up, I would like to say that I agree with the position that watching sports (either on TV or at live sports events) is a waste of time because while doing this you do not get new information or do something to improve yourself, only thing that you do is spent your time. So it is important to use your time correct and with benefits.
