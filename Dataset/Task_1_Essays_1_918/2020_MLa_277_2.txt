There is no doubt that this days sport events are integral part of global culture. Watching the sport game on TV or in real life is one of the ways to distract from the routine and enjoy time away from office or class. I strongly believe that such way of spending free time is usefull, less trivial, quite entertaining and partially helpful for modern society.
Firstly, watching sport does really helps to distract from routine and enjoy time away from office or class, which is quite necessary this days. Taking into account that modern society seems to be the most busy in the world history, people are not used to relax and recover from their business, work, studies etc. Lots of science researches claimed that concentrating on the sport game significantly boosts brain skills, although person does not feel it. The idea is that watching sport greatly proves productivity and mental health, so person feels himself much better and relieved, and ready to come back to work routine. Secondly, world championships and sport contests are really thrilling. Lots of successful people and high-achievers were inspired by world-known football players or athletes. Due to the increased stamina of sportmen and incredible things that happen during sport competitions and games, a hundred of people might feel an immaculate feeling to make the goal or to realise the dream. Particularly, world-famous tennis or football players always motivate us to do something more, to have a go in new activities and they greatly enhance our self-confidence by own example.
Finally, I would like to draw attention again that today sport plays a crucial role in our society: it can be the main vehicle of achieving the dreams and, also, helps our busy mind relieve and take a break from work.
