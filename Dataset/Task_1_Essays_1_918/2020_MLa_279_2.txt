There is a long-lasting agreement that watching sports is a total waste of your free time. I presume that watching sports, especially live, is a very breathtaking action and surely not wasting of time. To begin with, sports itself and sports programmes watching is on the one hand relaxing and on the other breathtaking. I suppose that both of these feelings are good for human behaviour due to the big amount of happiness and adrenaline. For example, when you watch football on the stadium and support your favourite team with other fans, effect on your behaviour will be surely significant. Moreover, there is another advantage of watching sports. The core of it contains the idea of national propaganda. While watching sports some people will think that they could do such exercises. It will influence them to keep fit and to train a lot to win trophies. For instance, most people know such surnames as Jordan, Ronaldo etc. whose impact on sports development is more than enormous.
However, there are also a few bad points about watching sports. Sometimes people get so addicted to their favourite sport that they couldn't leave without watching it every day sitting on their sofa with a can of beer. In very negative cases it leads to overweigth, not paying attention to families and relatives and bad behaviour in case favourite team or player loss.
In conclusion, watching sports is not a waste of time at all, mostly it very advantageable.
