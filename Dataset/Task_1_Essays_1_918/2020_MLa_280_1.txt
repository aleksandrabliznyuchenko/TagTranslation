These two charts show changes in the use of Facebook from 2012 to 2013. According to the first vertical bar chart, the number of people using Facebook on desktops slightly decreased from 150 million to almost 140 million. In the contrast, Facebook's mobile users became more active - number of people using Facebook from telephones increased almost two times (from 60 million in 2012 to 100 million in 2013).
From the second horizontal bar chart it can be noticed that women use Facebook more actively than men. According to female users the most popular reason for using Facebook is sharing photos and videos. As for the males, there were two main reasons: receiving updates and sharing media content. Learning about ways to help others was the least popular answer among two respondent groups.
Overall, it can be seen that reasons for using Facebook are quite familiar according to both male and female users as well as Facebook is becoming more popular with mobile users rather than with desktop viewers.
