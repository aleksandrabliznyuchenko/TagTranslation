According to some, watching sports is not a useful activity because people waste their personal time. Even though sports are usually connected with healthy lifestyle, it does not mean they will take part in these activities. Despite some controversions related to this topic, I identificate watching sports as a very good way to spending one's free time. I personaly think that attending different sport events makes them more popular among population. It is a fact that majority of young generation admire football players like Lionel Messi, Crishtiano Ronaldo etc. As a consequence, lots of children try their personal skills on physical educational lessons, which means improving physical health conditions.
It is not a secret for anyone that watching sports games on TV is a very good way to relax and rest after hard working week. In spite of COVID-19 pandemic and very stressful living in general, probably lots of people would watch football match in order to beat stress.
Of course, there are some important arguments against my point of view. Majority of people, especially men, watch sports with their friends, and these gatherings are often accompanied by alcohol and fast food. This not only causes some health problems such as alcoholism and obesity, but also negatively affects relationships within family.
Even despite these important aspects, I strongly believe that watching different sports (neither live nor on TV) can impress people to overcome their personal fears. Through learning life history of famous athletes people can discover there is nothing impossible. Thus more and more children and teenagers can easily achieve their goals and make their wishes come true. Moreover, some global sports events like the Olyimpic games are very interesting topic to discuss.
All in all, I made myself no doubt that watching sports games is a very gripping, exciting and challenging activity.
