Sport have already become one of the most essential parts of our life. We could not imagine our lives without it. Some people derive pleasure from watching sports while others tend to think that it is a useless spend of time. This debatable topic has to be discussed.
From my point of view, watching sport is one of the most exciting and enjoyable way to relax. People have the opportunity to admire by the skills of the best athletes from all over the world. Moreover, it is very difficult to compare with something the chance that you have been given to see how people who spent all the life on sport siezed some results and inspired younger generation to dream about the same. Many children start doing sports after they had seen profissional tournaments or sport events.
Nevertheless, there are some people who are not of the same opinion. They suppose that people will not doing any kind of sport, if they watch it on TV or alive. Viewers watch tournaments despite of taking part in local competiteve events. Also, they really believe that professional tournaments do not have such emotions which you may face up in an unprofessional level. Athletes take part in competitions just to earn money.
I personally disagree with these people because professional athletes give examples that each person will have the opportunity to get results, if he works hard. Futhermore, it is always exciting to watch professional competitions because they have to do everything as possible to approve that they are the best one. You feel an exciting moment when your favourite team or sportsmen win because it is a historical moment and it always becomes a part of your positive memories.
Taking into consideration all mentioned above, watching sports does not have a negative influence at all. People who suppose that it is the spend of time can not find real benefits in the process. It is a kind of hobby which brings emotions and motivation to develop yourself in every sphere of modern life.
