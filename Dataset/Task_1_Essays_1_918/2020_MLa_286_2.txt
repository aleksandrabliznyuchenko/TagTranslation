Some people think that spending your leisure time watching sports is killing your time. However there are people who think that watching sports on TV or at live sports events is a good activity. I disagree with this statement because in my opinion you feel better after watching sports.
To start with, watching sports makes some people happy because they understand the point of sport games and they are eager to root for their favourite team, it just makes them feel better. What is more, sports help to cooperate and you became a part of something big (fan base, for example). Also, it is good opportunity to spend your free time with your family or friends.
Finally, you can be inspired by the game you see, it means you can do sports yourself in the future. For example, my father very often watched football as a child, then he started to do sports and now he is still going to play football with his childhood friends.
In coclusion, watching sports is a good way to spend your free time. For some people it can grow into a lifelong work, for some people it can be just pleasant pastime with loved ones.
