Some people say that wathing TV, and particularly - some sports events and games, is useless way of spending free time. In this essay I am disagree with that opinion and I also will give several reasons and arguments for that point of view.
First of all, it strongly depends on each individual's personal interests and hobbies. If one really adores wathing sports games, big events and olympiads, then it is up to him or her what to watch or attend and what TV programms to like. For example, I really enjoy observing cybersports shows and games and it is comforts me, then if it is provides plessure and happines to the person it can not be treated as the waste of time in any sense.
Moreover, such a hobby often encourages people to start doing sports by themselves and not just watching it via television. In one way or another one can feel himself confident enough to practice some little bits of excercises, being inspired by particular sports star or champion. Exampli gratia, dozens of stories are known of some simple people watching their favorite sportsmen during childhood and by the time they turn teenagers or adults they start to perform in particular discipline with the image of their coumir in head.
All in all, the opinion that wathcing spors anyways is the waste of time could be common among general public but I am fully disagreee with that state of mind.
