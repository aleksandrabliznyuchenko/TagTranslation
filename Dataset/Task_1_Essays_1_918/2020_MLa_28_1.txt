The charts show the differences in how people used Facebook in 2012 and 2013 and types of activities men and women thought to be the most essential reason for them to do there. Usage of desktops and mobile devices for logging in was presented, and also the changes in several most popular reasons for using Facebook was compared. There was 4 types, such as sharing medias, news, funny posts and volunteering.
The first chart reveals the general trend of decreasing the popularity of laptops and computers, whereas the part of mobile devices increased. The numbers of desktop version users lowered to less than 140 million from approximately 150 million, but the mobile usage rose twice from near 60 million to almost 100 million in 2013.
The second chart is about comparing in what purposes men and women connected to Facebook most: for example, women used it to post photos and videos in more than a half cases (54% of answers), whereas men did only in 39% cases. Seeing humoristic posts and helping others was women's goal more often either (comparing 43% to 35% and 35% to 25%). However, both men and women reported receiving updates as the main goal with an equal frequency: 39%.
