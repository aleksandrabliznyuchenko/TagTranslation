There is an opinion among some people that dedicating one's time to sport programmes on TV is unreasonable and these hours can be spent on much more useful things. I can just partially agree with this statement.
Let's start with the idea that many leisure activities, which apart from work and various home duties, can be estimated as non-beneficial and useless in a practical aspect and it could be replaced by something more productive. It is inevitably leading us to the point that the only thing people must do is working, that is not positive for physical as well as mental health. Nevertheless, there is no anything offensive if such time spending is a good way of relaxation for a particular person, which may contribute to recovering from some life problems and work. Moreover, Looking at the process of sports watching as a hobby, it emerges a high interest of certain individuals in this area by virtue of it delivering pleasure and inspiring.
However, people's experience show that such way of time spending may lead to addictiveness and a person can lose the contact with the outside world diving into 'TV world' full of emotions and events. This potential danger urges people to pace themselves but it is risky as may become uncontrolled. In addition, close alternative are easily found. So, one of such alternatives visiting sport events in person, it let mix several benefits as such leisure time is active as well pleasant for sport events lovers.
Given the above, in each of people life balance should be reached. People do need to do that gives them pleasure as this is the key to happiness. At the same they should wisely approach the issues relating to leisure activities and as far as possible to mix business with pleasure.
