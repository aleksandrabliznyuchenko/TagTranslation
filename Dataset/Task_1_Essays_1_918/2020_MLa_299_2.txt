Nowadays there is a common belief that whatching sports both on TV and live accounts for a time spent in vain, with no significant or helpful in any way outcome.
Personaly, it is impossible for me to agree with such statement. In my opinion, watching sports is one of the great ways to spend free time. Firstly, watching basically anything always means learning something new. Sport-related events broadcasted on TV usually have running comentary so it is easy for the viewers to understand what exactly is happening on the screen and learning new terminology and rules along the way. Recent studies have shown that people who watch sports on TV are better at concentrating on particular pieces of information and memorizing it. Secondly, people who become sport fans are most likely to engage in these sport activities themselves. My younger brother has been interested in watching football matches on TV since he was 4 years old and now he is a player on the local junior team. What is more, whatching sports on TV or live passes as a hobby and having a hobby usually helps to meet new people interested in the same thing and make friends. There was a group of students in my high school who became friends due to the fact that all of them shared the same interest for going out and watching basketball matches live. As for today they are still close friends and never miss a game.
All in all, it seems that watching sports on TV or watching it live is a perfect way to spend time with friends, improve your memory and learn any sport-related information.
