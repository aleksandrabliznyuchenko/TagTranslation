Nowadays people can choose different kinds of sport as everyone can find a wide variety of sports. Watching sport has become one of the most popular activities, so a lot of people from all over the world like watching sports (either on TV or at live sports events). However, some people believe that this type of spending free time is a waste of time. I completely disagree with this statement and think that it is a good choice to relax and enjoy days.
Firstly, watching sport events is the great type to entertainment and relaxing from hard-working day or week for a lot of people. Usually people watch sport events to relax and forget about some problems. It gives them a lot of pleasure to watch it and then discuss it with thier families or friends. For example, my uncle Tom usually watches ice-hockey matches after his workday and then calles my dad to discuss the outcome of the match. After such events poeple, and also my uncle Tom, have a better mood and do not feel so tired. That's why i think people need to watch different sport events even on TV.
Secondly, watching sport events is a way of socialisation. Different countries have thier own national sport championships, so people create fan clubs to support the team and make new friends who share such interests. Thanks to this people can discuss the latest sport events, be the part of the team and fan club. FOR instance, many people meet their love or faithful friend there.
To conclude, i strongly believe that watching sports (either on TV or at live sports events) is not a waste of time, rather the opposite, it gives people chances to relax and become the part of big community. As a rule, people who like watching sports have good mental health and social skills. Although it is a good way of relaxation, socialisation and learning something new about sport for people from all ages.
