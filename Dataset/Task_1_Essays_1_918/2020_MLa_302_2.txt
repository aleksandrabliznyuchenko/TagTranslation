The issue of watching sports on TV has always aroused sharp discussions. Some people believe that such activities are not reasonable way to spend your time. The others, however, consider that if man or woman enjoy this type of activity, no one can say that this person just waste his or her time. Personally, I am agreed with the second group of people and trere are a lot of reasons for it.
To begin with, I would like to say that activity like watching sports on TV has many advantages. The first one is connected with a fact that as rule people who watch sports on TV do it at the most comfortable conditions, because there is not more comfortable place in the world than our homes. Thus, people who watch TV sports get more pleasure than other people. Moreover, nowadays people have to pay money to get a chance to watch some sports events in real life. Sometimes tickets cost really much or even it is impossible to find tickets for you and your family or friends. So, people have to watch this great show without close people Obviously, this problem is impossible, when people want to watch some sports on TV. As a result, watching it on TV is just a perfect way to watch some sports with your family and friend. Say that such things are waste of time incorrectly.
There is, however, darkside of this way. Only in real life spectators can fell this atmosphere of big sports events, because only this way gives people opportunity to hear all sounds. It results in situation, when spectator after watching sports, did not get true felling.
In conclusion I could say that subject is very controversial. Some people believe that such activities are waste of time because of lack of true fellings, whereas I as well as a lot of people think that because of comfort and chance to do something with your family and friend watching sports on TV can not be a waste of time
