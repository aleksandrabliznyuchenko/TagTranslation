Spo have sbeen one of the most popular type of entertainment for years. Some believe that it is the waste of time, while others think it is the best way to relax. I believe it is good form of relaxation.
Many people think it is not great to seat on a sofa and watch sports. Firstly, they think it has no helpful or interesting content and it only makes people lazy and fat. There are a lot science channels that can show some really relevant information that helps to improve skills. Secondly, some people believe that watching sports makes viewers to be the part of the system by showing ads and encouraging to buy more food, services and goods. This kind of influence on people can result in growth of consumer society and health problems.
Another part of society prefer to think that sports are good for spare time. I belive that watching sports is much better than watching other channels because there are a lot of shows that have no quality and intellectual value. For example, channels for kids show a lot of strange and awful content, whereas the sports can not only entertain kids with no harm but also to give them the encouragement to go to sport classes. It is also great to have time with friends watching sports because the process of sport games allow people to communicate and discuss some issues. It is easy to make friends watching sports but not the shows.
In conclusion, I disagree that watching sports is bad way to spend time and believe that sports can have great impact on people and communities.
