Nowadays, the sports (especially the Olimpic games) are really popular around the world and a lot of people trying not to miss the translation or watch it real life. There is an opinion that it is pointless and people waste their time watching such TV programms or spend money on tickets. I partly disagree with this point of view.
I disagree with opinion that watching sports is a waste of time. Firstly, it is a good way to made up good emotions. For example, you are a big fan and cheering your favourite sportman. You are really happy if he win and you share with other fans the anxioty during the race. Secondly, watching sports can be a good motivation to start active life style or doing these kind of spotrs by yourself. As an illustration, a child could see his sport idols on TV and trying to do his best to achieve such goals and become a world-knowm champion.
However, on the other hand watching sports can be useless. There is no new information or interesting facts. While people are watching it, they do not grab something important or useful for their life. For example, quizes and other TV games help to develop your logic and give you a chance to learn something new about the world around.
In conclusion, in general I tend to think that watching on TV or visiting sports events in real life is bringing to our life different emotion
