Nowadays majority of people suppose opinion that watching TV sports shows and events is a bad way to spend time. I do not agree with this opinion because it is a good practise for sportmen, also it is interteiment for other people.
First, professional sportmen watch TV sports events for personal pracrice. Other words, when sportmen watch sports, they try to understand strategy or technic of this kind of sport. It is useful for sportmen and their professional skills. For example, often hockey player watch hockey matches other teams and discuss mistakes or wondeful strategy. Afterwords, hockey player do not this mistakes in our matches.
Second, watching sports is a amazing interteiment for people who enjoy sport. Some people really like any kind of sport, and they are fans. For this people watching TV sports shows is not a waste time because it is like a hobby. For instance, my father is a really fan of hockey. He often watch TV match and happy for favourite team if they won. Also the father like to buy ticket for match.
In conclusion, most people claim that watching TV sports shows and events is a waste of time. I do not support this opinion. I think that it is a good way to impove prosrssional skills of sportmen. Also for some people watching TV sports is a really hobby. Sport is a life.
