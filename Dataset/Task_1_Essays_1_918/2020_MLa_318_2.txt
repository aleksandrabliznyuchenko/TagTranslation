Some people are point of view, that sport events on the TV are not very usefull. It were better to spend that time for something more practical. I agree with that statement.
Foremost, it is very important to be fit all the time. For that reason people should do sport. People, who prefer to watch sport, do nothing for they own health. Moreover, watching TV can be connected with eating junk food, drinking beer and so on6 as we can see during Worldcup in footbal or another sport. This "life style" cannot be called healthy, in contrast, it provides diseases as obesity.
In my opinion, people watch sport to spend time with friends as one of the option. It will be better to spend that time for doing sport in reality, because it is special type of motivation and gives more positive emotions. People can do sport outside, what is realy excellent for health. There are a lot of clubs, where we can play footbal or do yoga exercises or some more attractive sport types. There people have more closely relationships, because of interesting hobby, and gives more topics for speach. It gives also the opportunity to choose some new intertament. It is always good to feel the own progress in some deal. That differ humbum watching TV from real sport. D To summarise, watching TV cannot give people new knowledge or abilities, whereas real sport provide good emotional feeling and health.
