One can say that watching sport events, no matter in real life or prerecorded, is not a good way to spend time. Personally I totally disagree with this statement.
Firstly, watching sports brings people closer to each other. As an example, in sport bars it is possible to see the unity of fans watching some sport event. These king of people often form groups where all of them can have fun together, if they are fans of the same team. Another example is parent-child relationship. It is often very difficult for parent to find common activities with his child. However, if child loves sport, the best way to spend time together is to watch a game. It will likely make relationship warmer and probably create some good common memories.
Secondly, watching sports often makes people want to do sports. Watching sports encourages a lot of people below 30 to go outside of their houses and start training new technic, which they saw during professional match. For example, my friend was sitting at home for the whole summer without any will to go out, but when he accidentally switched channel to the one, where his favourite footbal team was playing, he decided to go to his town house for a week with his school friends just to play footbal with them and learn to play better with new kick he saw on TV. Stories like this demonstrate one of the most important purposes of existance of professional sport. It is essential especially these days, when some people need some help to recover from apathy they got during the recent lockdown.
In coclusion, watching sport is important to always have common interests with people and also to keep yourself motivated to do sports and get better in it. So, for me, it is clear that watching sports cannot be treated as a waste of time.
