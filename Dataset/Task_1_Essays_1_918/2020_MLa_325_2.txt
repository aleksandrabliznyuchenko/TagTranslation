According to some people, watching particular sport is just killing your precious time. However, I totally disagree with this statement because in my opinion it is useful activity and has many benefits.
To begin with, by watching sports on television or from a stadium is an opportunity to people to gather and have a nice time with their friends or family to cheer for their favorite team. These people can have different religious, social status or political views but at this time, they are gathering to watch a sport event. However, when the game has started these people only concern to watch a glorious victory of their team. It is obvious, that such events bring people closer and help them to establish new bonds with each other. When their team wins, it is celebration to all of them and in this time, people are becoming happier despite difficulties in life. For instance, Russian study shows that many people during World Football Championship established huge amounts of community bonds all over the world.
To addition, community bonds is not the only benefit of watching sports events. Although, watching sports is helping people to stay fit as professional sportsmen do. For example, recent British study shows that teenagers adore sporting heroes and want to be like them, especially look like them and many teens who watch sports events, like to be in a good shape and lead a healthy lifestyle. In the other hand, watching other shows does not have any positive effects on human. These people are becoming fat and getting many others diseases that affect on health negatively.
To conclude, in my opinion, watching sports is not waste of time, it provides many benefits that are helping you during whole life. It has strong positive impact on your body and your communication with others.
