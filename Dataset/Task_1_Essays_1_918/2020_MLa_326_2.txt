A vast part of modern society share an opinion that sports do not deserve such an attention of public. This essay is partly agree with this position, adding that any type of show if fine until viewers don't get cray about it.
Usually sports fans say in defense of their position that sports produce a positive effect on people. According to them, a person considering himself as a true sports fan must do a lot of sports in real life. However, that is absolutely not true for the most part of people. Actually the majority of sports fans consider sports as a hobby and separate it from all their other businesses. Moreover, according to my experience the majority of gym visitors and healthy lifestyle enjoyers are not really keen on any particular type of sport. In this case I would say that sports is more of a show than a motivation for its fans.
As a matter of fact, sport shows have a lot of in common with any other type of shows, such as reality shows or comedy shows. Basically, quite every person prefers one or another way of having rest without getting any positive effect other from relaxation. Eventually, in my opinion that is what most of people do. However, talking about sports, what happens quite often is the situation when a person gets severely mad about sports and does nothing except for watching or attending sports events. Therefore, there is nothing bad about being a sports fan until a person has some other business to do.
Overall, watching sports is just a usual hobby, which allows its fans to rest. However, it contains negative side to, which is exactly the possibility of becoming a crazy fan. Nevertheless, if a person has other things in his mind, nothing bad shall happen.
