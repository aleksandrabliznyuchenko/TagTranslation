There is an opinion that spending time on watching sport is truly useless, no matter if you watch it live or online. Personally I do not agree with this statement and I thing watching sport can be really helpful and in the following paragraphs i will share my ideas on this topic.
As I have already mentioned, there is an idea that watching sport is a bad way to spend your free time. Those who stand for this point of view say that there is nothing interesting while watching others doing sport and this hobby has no benefits. However, team sport games can be really entertaining for fans. The reason I think so is that for example a football game is always a huge event for those who love football. Fans get together, communicate with each other and cheer for their favourite team. It is a great way to spend time with your friends and family and it actually brings people closer. Moreover, it is a great way to entertain yourself or even relax. That is why businessmen and other busy people love to spend their time watching sports. It helps them to think of something else and not to care about their work for a minute.
Watching sports is not all about having fun. For some people watching sports is a motivation to stay in shape, especially for kids and teens. They often have a sportsmen that they adore and they may try follow their lifestyle, including practicing spots. Also, there is also an opinion that people who watch sports are more healthier and intelligent. This is obviously a huge advantage of being a sports fan and watching sports.
In conclusion, everyone has their own tastes and hobbies, but it seems to me that watching sports is not a waste of time. It provides a positive vibe into people's life and helps to find yourself.
