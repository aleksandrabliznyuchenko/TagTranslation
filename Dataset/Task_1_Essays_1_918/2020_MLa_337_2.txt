There are some people who argue that visiting sport events as well as watching sport programmes on TV take a lot of time in vain. I disagree with this idea. From my perspective, such activity is very useful for both an individual and society.
First of all, sport is a good entertainment. Sport games and competitions are full with unbelieveable moments and stories. Thus, watching sport might give a lot of emotions to a spectacular. To illustrate, the Olympic Games are treated not only as a serious competition, but also as an amazing performance. People enjoy following this event in person or on TV. This is one of the most exciting experience of life which people remember for years.
Secondly, watching sport facilitates people communication. This activity allows people to share some feelings together being in the same place and following the same game or competition. For instance, football teams have a lot of fans. It is a very strong community, as they share love to this kind of sport and spend time side by side. Moreover, these events encourage making new friends. Sport live events are usually common, so there is a large number of people there. For example, basketball games have some hundreds of spectaculars.
All things considered, watching sports is a great way to spend time, since it gives people impressions and memories. Besides, sport unites people and put them together.
