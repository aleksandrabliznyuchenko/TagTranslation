Nowadays, there is an arguable opinion about sport-like content consumption. Some people aware that watching sports does not worth the time that has been spending on it by the large part of worldwide society. In my opinion, for someone watching such content could be a crucial part of their life. This essay will represent a few reasons why wathcing sports is not a wasting of time. First of all, there is a large number of people who have deicided to make sports the part of their career. Undoubtedly, that category of society have to watch a lot of content and visit sport games to be in touch with currunt news and updates in the world of professional sport and fitness. It could be either people for whome sports is their cumplosory work, for instance, judges, commenators, trainers, athlets, football players and other professionalists, or people who work in such fields as sport analytics or marketing and branding.
Second of all, literally everybody has some specific hobbies they do in a free time after a general work or on holidays or weekends. Some people like reading or knitting, other enjoy physical activities, such as running and climbing. Also, there are a large amount of people who prefer to watch sport content or visit a new game of their favorate football team.
To sum up, there is no reason to judge people who spend a vaste amount of time on watching sports. Personally, I do not like "wasting" time on a such content, basically because it is not in a field of my current interests. However, all people are free to spend their time in a way they would enjoy it and not regret it.
