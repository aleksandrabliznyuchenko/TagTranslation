The author discuss the problem of procrastinating while you watch sport. I am totally disagree with this opinion.
The first reason I'd like to mention is that you can learn a lot while you looking at sportsman, how he cooperate with his team. Equally important is that you gain some new knowledge about the game: new ways, interesting tricks. Also I should say that teams exhibit a great level of a team spirit.
Usually normal people watch sports in their free time because it is a good way to relax after a hard day. They love the game of their favourite team and try to support it. For example, in Russia there are a huge number of fans of ice hockey game. We have one of the strongest team in the world.
But on the other hand, spending time by watching game on digital devices could not be so effective for relax. According to specialists form HSE this kind of activity does not help us because of monotonous work for our eyes. So, it could be said that watching sport at home is a kind of waste of time. To conclude I should say there is an old saying, but it common knowledge that it better to see at ones than hear a lot of time. So if you a real fan or you just want to relax so welcome to see the game of your favourite team or even a one sportsman.
