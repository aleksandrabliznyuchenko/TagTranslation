It is common beliefe that watching sports events is not usefull or valueable for people. I partly disagree with this statement, because a lot of people enjoing while they watch it and can feel them part of something bigger. Althought that time can be used more smart by others and everyone can decide what better for him or her by himself or herself. I believe, it can depend on a lot of reasons what to watch or do in a current time. On the one hand, nowadays sports events become more fun and good for rest by families. This activity can be liked by all relatives. So, that is why they can spend time with each other and fascinate. Also people who interested in sports can have exciting discussion about diffrent teams or strategeis and etc. It is helpful for make strong relationships or meet a lot of new friends. Moreover, if child like to watch some sports, it can provide him or her to make exercises and have a good body shape. He or she can become a famous sportsman.
On the other hand, a lot of people do not realy interested in sports and they can think that they should not waste their time, because they can spend it for study or variaty and a lot of different important things in their lifes. I can understand it, because I can rest much better while walking on a street and do not take care about my favorite football time for example. However, a lot of other hobbies are in real.
In conclusion, there are a lot of different people and different views in our world and no one can tell you what you should do and for what you should spend your time.
