Nowadays, sports are becoming more and more popular. Everyone has access to any sport event: you can watch it on TV for free or buy a ticket to visit the stadium, but there are people who truly believes this is a waste of time. Personally, I totally disagree with this point of view for several reasons.
At first, I think that watching anyone doing any kind of physical activity is important. When I was a kid, it had become a reason why I went in for sports: I had visited a football match and it inspired me, so I dreamed to become a brilliant player. The idea behind this real-life story is that it is important to test yourself. Watching people doing physical activity or having a competition in sports may has an influence on anyone, so it will make you want to go in for something new.
At second, watching sports on TV or at live events brings you a huge amount of emotions, especially if you chose a team and wish they win. I am sure that being nervious when someone struggles in any kind of competition or feeling happines after your favourite player or team has successed is undescribable. I wish everyone would have been through it.
Taking everything into account, it has to be said that everyone can have his own opinion: no one force you to watch sport events if you do not like it or do not feel anything positive, but I am sure that visiting live events or watching it on TV is an important part of my life.
