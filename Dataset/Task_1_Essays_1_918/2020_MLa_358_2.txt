Spending time watching sports events is not worth it. Some people claim that any sport is waisting of time. However, others believe that watching sports can bring a lot of positive emotions and improve knowledge of this sport.
In my opinion, watching or doing any kind of sport professionally is waste of time and health. Firstly, people always get stressed because of hard situations while they are watching sport. It can provide heart problems. Secondary, i don't know healthy people from any sport. This happen because they need to do a lot of exersizes everyday and it is not good for their bones. So, people watch sport and after that they are trying to do some sport elements and get real problems with their health. Finally, my friend was a really big fan of football. He watch a lot of matches on tv and after 5 years only that he got is bad eyes.
On the other hand, there are those who oppose my opinion. They think that watching any sport can improve team spirit and also it is really good opportunity to make friends. Also, some people can inspire by any sportsmen and start they own career. There are a lot of money and good people in sport industry, it could be good idea to go there. In addition, people become happy when their team wins and gets prizes.
I doubt this point of view as to my mind watching sport is not so important. Moreover, sport careers are very risky and about 1 percent of all people from sport gets more than 300.000$ a year. People are spending time like this because they are lazy and don't want to do by themselves.
All in all, it is not good idea to spend time watching sport. It can cause a lot of problems and people can do some things that are more important in their lives.
