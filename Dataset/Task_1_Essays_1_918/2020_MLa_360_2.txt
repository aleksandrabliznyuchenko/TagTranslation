One group of people believes that watching sports is a waste of time. However the other people think the different way. As for my opinion I feel that both sides have some advantages and disadvantages. I can understand why some people think that sport events are userful for viewers, however it is pretty fun to spend some free time like this.
On the one hand, watching sports is interesting hobby. As we know people all over the world like to watch football either on TV or at live events. I find this hobby fun for spending time with family or friends. For instance, the football world cup was in 2018. It was very exiting to follow the success of the Russian team. The whole country was very happy. Fifteenth of july was the last day of world cup and it was my birthday. There were a lot of fans on the Red Square. I had fun with my friends.
On the other hand, it is much more userfull and fascinatingly to do sports by yourself. You can do whatever you want: skiing, football, basketball, badminton and more other. Playing sports is good for your health. For example, I feel much better when I do some sports in the morning. My brother likes to joining me. Besides sport helps us to be strong and friendly family.
In conclusion i want to say that both points of view take place. Watching sports events is exiting, however doing sports is very userful and fun.
