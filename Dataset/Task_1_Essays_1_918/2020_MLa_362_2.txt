It is argued that watchhing sport games on television or at live events are unuseless and just a wast of time. I disagree with this because there are a lot of people how really love sports and like watching it.
Even thoug it is true that many people specialy teenagers spent a lot of time watch sports and they do not do there homework. however I think that watching sports are note a waste of time if you can manage your daily life. One reaseon for this is that watching sports can encourage you to play sports. For instance that who like to watch football matches they usually play football, and is good for there health and well being.
Another reason why i believe that wtching sport games or attend it are not unuseless is that beacause monitor sports are good for our mental health. to illustrate this, a poll carried out by Oxford University in 2016 stated that around 75 percent of people who watch sports game are more helthier than whom not. And that because whene people watch this kind of programm (sport programm), the harmon called dopamine increased, and this harmon affects the entire body, make it more healthier.
In conclusion, although waste all your time watching sports or going to this kind of events are bad, but when you manage your life and organizes your time, you can watch and go to sport games and enjoy it.
