There is the mention, that watching sports is unusefull way to spent your time. I partially agree with this statement.
The first reason to agree this mention, is that watching sports is fun. It is one of the easiest ways to spent your holidays happy with beer and friends. You can do it at home and on sport events. Therefore if you have tickets and go to the stadium, you can have unforgetable experience of collective unconsciousness with fans of your favourite sport team. But if it is not team sport, like chess, for example, you also can enjoy it in your free time. On the other hand, I think that this pastime is not very useful, because when you watch game, in real life or TV and online, you does not improve and train your own sport skills. You can more and more deeply feel team and game spirit internally, like player. When you watch it from monitor you cut down your experience.
Although, watching sport supports sport industry. It popularise sport in commercial way. Great sportmens nowadays are millionairs, but the wrong price, I think. Because to start career of professional sportsmen you must bring all your life in, but it is not garantee, that you can become the great.
In conclusion, I agree that watching sports is wasting your time, but also it the easy way to enjoy your not sportive life and I like it.
