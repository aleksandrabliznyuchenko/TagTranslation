There are many kinds of entertainment activities, and people often discuss which activities are better than others, and which are worse. One of negatively perceived activities is watching sports.
Let's discuss good sides of this activity. First of all, the main reason why people entertain themselves is resting. Sports can easily capture attention of a viewer, and this provides the viewer with an opportunity to forget about his troubles during a match.
But there is a negative side of it. Watching is passive action and it doesn't help to keep yourself in good shape or develop other good traits. This is common problem of all passive ways to rest: excessive ability to gain pleasure without need of doing something difficult affects motivation of a person in a terrible way. Additionaly, there are activities that can not only help to forget about everyday troubles, but also keep yourself in a good shape, like doing sports yourself or playing boardgames.
In my opinion, it is a nice opportunity to rest when I am too tired to do anything useful, but watching should be limited to this case in favor of more active ways of entertaining myself. I think that the opinion that watching sports is a waste of time is mostly right, but there are situations when it is good choice of what to do.
To sum up, there are huge negative sides of watching sports, but there are cases in which this activity can be a nice choice.
