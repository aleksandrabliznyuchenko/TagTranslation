There is no doubt that sport has a great impact on our life. Even if you are not inerested in it, you always notice multiple adverticements of football match or another Olimpic Games. At the same time, some part of the society argues that being a fun and watching sport events is useless, nothing more than a waste of time. Personally, I disagree with this statement.
Firstly, watching your favourite champion is really bteathtaking and full of pleasureble fillings. Everybody knows how it fills when you are coming home after hell of the day, tired of studying or hadr working, and all you want to do is just to relax. Some people like spending time communicating with their friends, others - playing table games or vidio games, other - doing physical exercises, others - watching TV-shows or sport competitions. So, enjoying sport events is simply another kind of relaxation which helps people to keep going.
Secondly, usually pleople who are watching sport events are doing it by services which are not allowed for free. For example, it may be a site with required subscribing for the certain period of time, which costs some money. More simple instance is that everybody has to pay for entering event on the stadium. All these money are connected with the revenue of not only sportsmen, but of all people who work in this sphere. As a result, if nobody watches sport, then unique males and felames who can do physically something, what most of population can not, would not earn money by their talents.
Finally, I think that watching sport events is both pleasure for one who is watching and salary for one who is performing.
