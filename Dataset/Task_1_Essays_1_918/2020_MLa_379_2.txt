Across time people have always considered hobbies a very important part of their life. Among others sports have become a very popular activity to enjoy, ether in doing sports or watching sports events live or on TV. However, some people believe that watching sports is pointless. Personaly, I don't watch sports, but i can see why someone would find it appealing. In my essay I will disguss this point of view and provide my opinoin.
There are a few reasons why watching sports can be interesting. Firstly, usually it is a groop activity, so people can not only watch a championship, but also socialize. Sports fans can spend leisure time with their friends or family wathing a foorball game. For instance, my aunt and her family watch football games together and place bets on who's giong to win. It's very exiting. Furthermore, live shows give people the opportunity to meet sobody new, who has similar interests.
Secondly, watching sports may simply provide people with emotional release. Sometimes the feelings get built up inside with no available way to express them. For example, having had a hard day at work it can be good for someone to relax and watch a game of their favourite sports team. The ability of a person to escape current problems just for a little while can be very refreshing.
In conclusion, I would like to say, that athough some might think that watching sports is a waste of time, for other people it might be the exact opposite. In my opinion, there are sertain benefits to watching sports, like socializing and relaxing after a long day, so no wonder sports fans enjoy it so much.
