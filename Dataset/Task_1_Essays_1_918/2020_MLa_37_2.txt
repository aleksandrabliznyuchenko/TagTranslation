Some humans say, if you watch sports on TV or live, you waste your time. I absolutely disagree with this opinion.
Firstly, people can not have chances to spend time for sport. For example, he or she has problems with health, because of have no way to play football, but what he can do, if likes this play? Right, he can only watch different matches on TV. And this can help him or her to chill.
Secondly, someone can have a difficult work, which spend more time. And he can not play or train because have not energy just to do it. He can only come back to home and sit on the bed. That is all, that he can. For instance, people can be car-driver, which work from morning to night, and he has a time only to sleep. And the one chance to chill, it is watching sports during a work day.
On the other hand, that is can be a waste of time, when someone have healty, time to do it, but he does not do it. For example, someone go to home and him friends say: 'do you want to join play?'. And he answers, that have no time, because he needs to wash him car, for instance. And he lied because want to do nothing. and in that way may say, that is a waste of time. Finally, I think that we can not say about a waste of a time, when watch sport on TV or at live sports events, because people can have different reason to do it, maybe it is a hard work or probably promblems with body.
