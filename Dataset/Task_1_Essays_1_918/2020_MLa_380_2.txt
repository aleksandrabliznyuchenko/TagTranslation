Nowadays the popularity of wathching different sports events is growing. Some people find it exciting, but some think visa verse and claim that it is a time-wasting. In my essay I will take a look at both points of view, provide some arguments supporitng my piont of view.
On the one hand, it is clear that sitting in front of tv or at a stadium and watching sportsmen taking part in different competitions is not as good for heals as doing sports. It is well-known fact that this point of view can usually be found among women, and because of that misunderstanding among couples may occur. In my point of view it is not the reason to consider wathcing sports to be useless or a time-killing action.
On the other hand, watching sporting events can help to relax and gain some positive emotions from watching, for example, the perfomance of your favourite team of sportsman. Watching a spectacular game also brings excitement even if you watch this not as a fan of particular team.
Now I'd like to provide my own attitude to this topic. I am fond of playing volleyball and never miss a chance to take part in game. Sometimes, when both teams really want to win despite the fact that they are not the professionals, situation happens when the game is so spectacular that, for example, eldery people come to watch this and this cannot be because of boredom or some other reasons. As the one who was given a chance to participate in such sitiation as a player of a team, I can say that being participant is more breathtaking than being a spectator of this.
