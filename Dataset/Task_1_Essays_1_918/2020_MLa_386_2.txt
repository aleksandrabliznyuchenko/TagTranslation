In opinion of some people, spending time for watching sports is a waste of time. However, I disagree with them. In my opinion, watching sports is activity, which has a lot benefits.
To start with, watching sport you can learn a lot of new skills from players and teams your are watching at. Also, watching sports with our loved ones and friends is great opportunite to spend free time with them. Moreover, disscussion of watched matches is a great topic for conversation for the week ahead. And of course, nothing beats the drive that you feel rooting for your favorite team.
On the other hand, watching sport is not active type of spending free time. This thing is not good for your health. To add with, many fans prefer to enjoy watching matches with a bottle of beer or chips or both of this items, which is even more damaging to health.
Contrary to this, a lot of sports lovers often imitate their idols, trying to copy them. This benefits healthy lifestyle. Some of this fans growes up into real sports stars. For example, Neymar Jr now is one the best football players in the world, but his love for sports came from watching football matches. So, there are many such in sports field.
In conlcusion, watching sports is a good way of spending time, and it is a good hobby for some people. So, people should encourage their children to develop interest of watching sports. Of course, its has some negative cases, but benefits are overlapping them completely.
