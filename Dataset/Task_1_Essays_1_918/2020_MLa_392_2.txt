It is argued by some that watching sports is a waste of time. I completely disagree with this position and in this essay i will state the reasons for my view.
The most compelling reason for holding to my view is that all sports events are very emotional moments. Most of fans go to see a spectacular competition, to see their favourite sportsman or a team, to scream, to worry about the winner. Lastly, every game is an intrigue, because noone know who will win, so all fans and participants are waiting the results with a faint heart. Ofcourse when there are Olympic games it is obligatory to watch it if you are a patriot and you are proud of your country achievements.
Another reason for my opinion is that sport is a hard job and people come to see others achievments. Sometimes it looks like a miracle - when people show so hard- worked skills, talants, others high reasults and viewers can not believe in what they see. It is fantastic feelings. The best people in some skills must be popular because others will admire and take example doing sport and as it known, it is very good for our health.
To sum up, sport is a big competition which brings a lot of great emotions, someone can make idols from sportsman and repeat to work hard and achieve the goals set. Also to be proud of fatherland and admire someone special - is a wonderful feeling.
