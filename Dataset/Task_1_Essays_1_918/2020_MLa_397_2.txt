Nowadays technologies developing at a rapid pace and there are so many ways to expand your knowledge in science or IT shpere. Thereby, some people claim that it is time-wasted to watch sport events or some TV program about sports. In my opinion, despite several other time-spendings are available, browsing some sport game or competition in live also deserves time distractions.
On the one hand, it can be really good for people's health to keep an eye on sport events or sportsmen. To start with, the achievements of some athletes can motivate people to do sports even if they are at their own home. For example, modern fitness trainers often open some online-schools and start a TV show about weight loss or healthy habits and so on.
On the other hand, spying on sports people can be not so useful for a certain category of people. Firstly, envious people can get upset ang give up at the success of others. For instanse, a few years ago my brother considered himself as a sport loser and always thought that he is so far from such peaks and decided to develope into another area of life. In conclusion, altought there some reasons for not to following up the sports, I am still convinced that it is a good activity with a wide range of choice, so you just need to fing the one that suits you personally.
