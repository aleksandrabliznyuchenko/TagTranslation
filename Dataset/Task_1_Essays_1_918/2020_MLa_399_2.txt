Nowadays there are more and more football, basketball, hockey matches and consequently an increasing number of sports channels on TV or YouTube. Some people claim that people who watch such events spend their time uselessly. I disagree with the above opinion because of many reasons. In this essay I will try to express my point of view on this issue.
First of all, in my opinion, some viewers and visitors of sports events are keen on these sports and they dreamed about being a professional football or basketball player in their childhood, but do not have a physical, financial or another possibilities to reach this goal. So, such people are going to sports events to become more closely to their dreams. I am convinced that watching and visiting sports matches can motivate some children or even adults to become professional sportsmen or start a healthy lifestyle. What is more, for some part of people it is a kind of relaxing after a hard working day, or a thing that they do to meet with their friends. For instance, we with my five friends go to my room and watch football matches every Sunday at 9 pm o'clock.
Finally some people such as journalists or bloggers should visit or watch sports events as it is a part of their work. There is no doubt that they do not spend their time irrationally, because they write articles, make videos or even documental films about mathes they visit. A good illustration of this is my sister Anna. She is studying at the faculty of journalism and sometimes go to hockey championships as a viewer to make her homework about sports events.
Taking everything into consideration there are two points of view on the issue. But I am convinced that watching football, basketball, hockey, tennis mathes and going to stadiums where there are such events are not a waste of time, because it helps people to visualize their childhood dreams, meet with old friends and even work.
