Some people are convinced that watching sport events is a wasteful and uselesss method to spend a day. I agree with this opinion as there are another occupationg that can be realized successfully. Besides, this deal is extremely life consuming.
Firstly, this occupation is deceptive as it gives misleading sense that the one is doing sports. This position can be destructive as a person has to understand that it is better to do sports instead of watching it in a stable position. Furthermore, the program takes the same amount as a good training. That is why, it is better to stimulate you organism while training instead of watching it at home or even in a special event building where a tictet is required.
Secondly, watching sports can be expensive and time consuming. There is a great amount of subscription that give a person the ability to visit every local game of the loved group. From this point, it means that a person can visit more that ten events throughout a season. That is why, this person will not "lose a chance" to surport admirable group, which will take free time that could be spent on personal life, mental health and phisical health.
Thirdly, this engagement is slitely underestimated: the one has to prepare himself for the game, buy a tictet to go for the event, find a partner for the evening and allocate time for queue and other nuisanses. This cannot be a relaxing way of spending a time. In other words, it is better to find another occupation like meditation or doing sports thta is not that comsuming and nervous.
To sum up, watching sports cannot be a helpful and agreeable way to spend free time as it requires nice budget, tons of unnecessary time and it cannot replace training that shoul be in everyone's schedule.
