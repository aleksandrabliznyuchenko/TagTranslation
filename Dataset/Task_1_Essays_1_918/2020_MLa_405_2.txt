It is argued that a lot of people consider that it is not productive to watch sport programmes and take part in sport events. This essay agree with that suggestion completely. This essay will, firstly, discuss the fact that sport can unite people and secondly, will look at how sport makes a people love their country.
Firstly, sport usually unites people because if people watch sport competition on TV or even go to the sport even they often do it with someone alse. People call their friends or stay at home with their family and relatives and begin to watch a wonderful game. Even when the person go to the competition alone he or she will always find someone else to share vivid emotions. For example, when my brother's friends were ill and could not go to the football match with my brother, he went to this competition alone. However, the atmosphere was so friendly and my brother quickly found people to talk about the team, the best football player and also about the hole football match.
Secondly, sport can not be waste of time because people become patriotic. When the person watch TV or go to the live sport event he or she usually wants the native country to win. Especially if the competition is very important for the World Sport, like The Olympic Games or The World Football Champion, people do not miss the event, put on clothes with their native country's flag or other symbols, sing a hymne and even cry when the country does not win. For instance, according to the research by Oxford University about 80% of people become to love their country more when they watch a sport event.
To sum up, people often believe that watching sport on TV and even go to the sport competitions are the worst ways to spend time without any benefits. However, I absolutely consider that sport in different kinds and forms can be very useful and it can have only positive sides for each person. Sport, firstly, unites people and secondly, makes everyone a real patriotic person.
