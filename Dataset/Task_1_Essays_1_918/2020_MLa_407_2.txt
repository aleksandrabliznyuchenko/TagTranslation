It is argued that sports programs on TV and sports events do not worth time. I can not agree with this statment. This essay will, firsly, discuss benefits it brings to peoples mental health and, secondly, point on the fact that such things can bond people toghether.
To begin, people live in difficult time and desparately need to relax. Leasure acitivity in form of watching sports programs on TV with friends or family can be pleasant. During this process people reduce stress and rash adrinaline which cause positive effect on mental statement. The data of the recent research of HSE university among students demonstates that lots of students doing sport or watch diffrent sports events which help them to stay in mind during academic year. On the basis of this information it is clear that sports activities even in such form bring people positive emotions and mental stability.
Moreover, it is not only leasure activity, but also an instrument to relate people and make new connections. The fact is that people become closer to each other, because they united by support for the same team, so they share the same interest. According to my own experience absolute stranges can bulit their relationships on this basis or this is how my friend found fiance.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that watching sports programs on TV or live has its own benefits such as reduction of stress caused by everyday routine and material for new relationships. So it can not be said that this activity is useless.
