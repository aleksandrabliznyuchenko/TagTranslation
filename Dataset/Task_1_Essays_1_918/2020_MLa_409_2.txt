Nowadays the growth in the popularity of sports has provoked constant controversy on whether is it beneficial for people watching sport events or it is simple the waste of free time. From my perspective of view, watching sport on TV programmes or in live is very beneficial for people.
Firstly, person can learn more useful information about different kinds of sports while watching sport events. When person watch TV sport channels he gest useful knowledge about the process and rules of particular sport activity. As a result they may be interested in sport activities and will take part in different competition in the future. It also can be very useful for people with special abilities or for those who have some problems with health and can not take part in sport activity by themselves. For example, according to the recent research conducted by British scientists in the Oxford University, the percentage of people who take part in sport activities was significantly higher among people who watch sport programs and events than for those who do not.
The second reason why I believe that watching sport have advantages for people is that it can help people to relax after tough day on work. Sport is very impulsive and competitive kind of activity so person can burst negative emotions while watching sport. For example, them my dad comes to home after work, he sometimes might be angry and can not do any household chores But then he watch some sport channels he becomes ca.m. In conclusion, although some people consider that watching sport is useless activity, I am still convinced that watching TV events encourage people to take part in sport competitions and give the ability to relax after tough day.
