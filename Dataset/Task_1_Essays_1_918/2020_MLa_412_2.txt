Nowadays, the TV is one of the parts of our lifes. it is argued that people claim that watching sports is a waste of time, others belive that not. This essay disagrees that it is useless process and I think that it has many advantages of using time like this.
First of all, when people see the sports on TV they can learn more about it and they will have more knowledge about this kind of sports. Also, it can be opportunity of spend time with friens and it be useful to watch some sports together and discuss, they can be closer to eachother because of same knowledges. It is better than spend time in phones all the day. For example, my friends and I really love to watch football on TV because it help us to have a fun, we can disscus all moments and spend an exellent time together.
Secondlly, when people watch the favorite sports on TV it can help them to want to stay fit and have healthy lifestyle. To my mind, people who really like watching the sports they really like to be a sucsess in their sport life too. For example, the statistic shows that about 60% people like the sports on TV because it evokes the desire to be an active person and be healthy. In the contast, I want to say that other TV shows can not presents so positive impact. I think it is because when people see their sport hero on TV they want to be like this person but in other TV program can not have such influence on people. Besides, such events like the sports in free time motivate people to physical activities and healthy life. In coclusion I want to say that watching sports is not wasting time and is not useless time. It has only positive effect on people to pursue a healthy way of life.
