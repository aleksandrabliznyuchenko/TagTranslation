More people is very passionate of watching TV programme and not stay the time on relatives or others important things. For example, my brother is interested in football matches.

Secondly, watching sports, no matter on TV or live events, can worsen health. Watching TV matches can damage your eyes. Live matches can worse your emotional condition.
