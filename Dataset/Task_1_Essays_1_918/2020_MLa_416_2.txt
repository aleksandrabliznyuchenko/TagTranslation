Nowadays a lot of people think that sports take our free time and we do not need to watch them. This essay agrees with this point of view. Firstly, this essay will touch such aspect as the limit of time in out modern world and, secondly, it will show how sports impact on people.
Firstly, time has its own value and it is very limitless. In our modern world people are very busy, working or studying everyday, so there is always not ehough time for doing some useful things or even learn something new. Sertanly, it is much better to spend some time with your family or friends, to read a book of to go to the art gallery in your free time, rather than watching sports. All this things can really help you to know something interesting and new and broaden your mind. For example, in Russia we even have a quote "Time is money", which means that you should do as much useful things as possible when you have some free time. Secondly, watching sports has a very huge impact on your mental health, which can lead to varios negative ramifications. A lot of people, mostly men, while cheering for theit favourite sport teams, can lose their pacience and start to get angrier, which can cause quarels or even fights between the watchers. For example, in 2013 at the football match between Barcelona and Manchester two men began to fight and one of them died in a hospital later.
In conclusion, I would like to say that nowadays we have very limitless amount of time and we cannot waste it on watching sport games, which also can be very dangerous, because it lead to fights between the watchers.
