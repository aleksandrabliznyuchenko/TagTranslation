It is argued nowadays that watching sports is a useless thing, like a waste time. This issue has it own pors and cons, and before refuting this statment, it is worth considering this phenomen from both sides.
Primarily, those people who find watching sports a wasting times may have the followng reasons. First of all, watching sports is a useless thing because you didnt take part in that sport game, so the resoloult shouldnt mentioned you. Moreover, we all know that stupid supporters, who drink alchocol, come to the stadion and starting to fight. That type of people make incorrect amoral things, so normal people hate that types of fan's and started to think that every people, who loves and watch sports are mad and crazy like those.
However, there is an opinion that waitching sport is a right thing. As example, sport programms on TV or in real life at the stadions are the propoganda of healthy-lifestyle, what is very important in our times. On another note, people can take off all stress and psychological troubles. Becouse while watching active sport games your mind will take a lot of adrenalin and another gormones, that make your more calm and cute. According the latest Oxford's research, people which watching sports regulary rarely have a depression, than people who didnt watching.
To conclude, in my view, there should be balance in watching sports. Of course, time to time you should go to the stadion with your friend to watch how play your city's team, support them and take the stress off. Anyway, we cant dont remember that we have our own duty, so you shouldnt spent all your time for watching sports. The better way, is a one or two hours in week spent for that thing.
