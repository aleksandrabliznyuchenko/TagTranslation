There is an oppinion that watching sports will not give you anything but the spent time. People think that you woud not learn any skills and just take more weight by eating junkfood in front of TV.
I personally disagree with that. Watching sports either on TV or at live events could make a person love sport and even encourage him to start a sport careere. Also, wathing sport could become a interesting tradition fore one's family and help family members to find common interests.
Watching Sport on TV is not only wasting of time. In situations, when a child wath sport from the very beginig of their life, they understand that sport is something essential, something that should be arund all the time. So, these kids are keen on sport, they love tranning, and their physical condition always be good. For example, according to statistic, 60 percents of athlets in USA decided to start their careere after they visited local sport event.
Wathing sport could also become a proper family tradition. A family members, that united by special hobby will be much cluser to each other. And it does not matter, wich sport people are interested in, they will still spend their time with family. For example, my family and i watched sport togeter since i remember. Even now, when i left home we still keep that tradition, that made our family so strong.
In conclusion, wathing sport is not a waste of time. It could bring to life new athlets, keep children's boody fit and unite members of family.
