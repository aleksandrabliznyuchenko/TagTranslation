Nowadays there are a lot of sport fans and they watched it by the TV or they visit sport competitions, but some people think that watching sports is not nesessary thing in our lives. I completely disagree with this opinion, because I am convinced that sport competitions can help you to relax and this type of leisure allows you to feel a motivation to do any sport activities.
The first argument in support to my point of view is a relaxing effect brings sport. When the person watch sport competitions, he can shift his attention from daily worrying problems on his personal happiness. It allows to get the pleasure and mental health. For example, recent research of Oxford University, 58% of men and women feel no headacke after watching sport competitions on TV.
The second argument is that sport competitions can motivate you to do sport. Every day many famous sportsmens inspire us to do new activities and support our health. For instance, according to statictics, 70% of sport fans decide to do sport after watching a really football match.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that some people beilived that sports waste your time, but I disagree with this opinion because watching sports can bring the relax to people and can inspire persons to achieve their goals and do sport daily
