Social networks are too important for everyone of us today. They help us to communicate and share outr impressions. Facebook - is one of the most popular social networks nowadays.
We can see two schedules to see the statistic information about Facebook. On the first schedule we can see that the most part of users use a desktop for Facebook (approximately 165 millions of users in March of 2012 and 140 millions in March of 2013), not mobiles (approximately 60 millions of users in March of 2012 and 100 millions in March of 2013). Besides we can see that in 2013 people started to use mobile much more than in 2012. If we see on the second schedule we will notice that women use Facebook more intensively than men: precent of women which are sharing photos/videos, seeing funny posts and learning about ways to help other is more than precent of men. But precent of women which are receiving updates is equal to precent of men which are receiving updates.
