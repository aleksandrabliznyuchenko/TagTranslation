It' is argued that watching sports events is a waste of time. This essay agrees with that suggetion completely bacause of sport during last 20 years became financial and political instrument. This essay will, first, look at how nowadays many sportmens using dopping, and then disscus how current sport became a political instrument, which using to increase country's authority in global area.
Firstly, from the Ancient times sport was using only like a competition between best sportsmens in the World and the champion became the most famous human. But nowadays, with development of science and genetics many sportsmens use different adds and medicine to take the first place in Olimpic Games or World Cup. For example, in the Olimpic Games, which spent in Sochi in 2014 more then 50% of Russian sportsmens using dopping and were caught by WADA.
Secondly, during last 50 years any Olimpic Games used goverments such an insrtument to take preasure on the other states.
