Nowadays there are a lot of fans sport events and not all people have opportunities to visit it at live or buy ticket. Because of that some people think that watching sport it is a good chance to spend free time. But other people claim that it is a not useful time for you. I agree that watching sports TV is interesting and useful because you can known about history of this kind of sports or if you fan support your favourite team.
Some people claim that sport TV give the people in the different part of the world chance to see their lovely match and it is great because in our world there are many poor people. Also, sport can help to developed our brain and musculies and it is obviously positive effect, I adree with this point. When children watch sportsmen they want to do the same and this example very important for our future. For example, i play in football nearly 10 years and i decided to choose it because of TV sport.
Others suggested that watching sport it just waste of time. They probably think so because they can not to play something and they do not understand the feeling when your team is win. Moreover, when you just sit front of the TV you can not develop your brain or so on and it is not some positive effects. For example, according to the research Oxford University, people who like videogames and sport on TV have lower figures for eye healthy that others people.
Finally, there are many opinions for watching TV sports or live games. There are group of people who against this events because it not useful and the opposed group who support because find it developed and interesting. I am disagree that watching sport on TV is wrong and dangerous.
