It is a well-known fact that a lot of people like watching sports on TV but there is a point of view that it does not make any sence. I disagree with that point of view because i suppose it is very useful and it is a good way to spend one free time. Fist of all, I believe that watching sports on TV or a live sports events it is a good way to expend your horizons and to learn something new. If you do not know how to play football for example or how to do figure skating and you can not try it and practice it for some reason, you could watch it and explore the rules and the others features of some kind of sports. But if someone thinks it is a waste of time he will not learn something new for him. For example, i have some friends who can not practice gymnastics on a professional level so they watch it on TV and now they are fans of it and they know all the rules, all athletes and etc.
Secondly, if we are talking about live sports events it is a good way for making new friends. In other words, there ia s strong relation between sports and friendship. If someone doesn not have a lot off friends he can make them on some sports event talking with the others fans of one or the other kind of sport. For instance, my little brother really likes, hockey but he does not have a lot of friends who likes it too because in country he levies it is not a popular kind of sports. So he went on a live hockey event some day and he met new friends there because a lot of hockey fans was at this event. Thus, watching live sports events it is a very good opportunity to make some new fiends.
To conclude i competently disagree that watching live sports events or TV it a waste of time because it has a lot of good opportunities.
