There is an opinion that there is no purpose to watch sports. However, some people disagree because they really enjoy this activity. Personally, I think that watching sports is a great way to spend my time. To my mind, observing sport activities is a great thing. Firstly, it can motify you. In case you are interested in sports, you might start doing it someday. There is no doubt that exercises are good for the health. For example: I started to play football with my friends after watching for 3 years straight different football games. A lot of children starts to do sports because they are watching it. This works as the propaganda of a healthy life. Secondly, watching sports is a good way to socialise. Personally, I met a friend at the football match, now we are watching sports together. Being fan of a team makes a person included into society of a friends, who also supports the team.
However, some people say that there is absolutely no point to watch sports. You are not doing anything useful while watching: you are not training, you are not learning anything new. There is an illusion that this activity might somehow make you a better person, but it only entertains you. Spending time just to entertain yourself is a waste of time. To conclude, staying healthy is a need for evetyone, for sure. Watching sports helps you to be more motivated and included in a community of people who are also interested in sports and might support you. Personally, I think that there is nothing bad in entertaining yourself by watching others people play or doing exercises.
