The bar charts illustrate the usage of Facebook by people by their desktops and mobile phones and the main reasons for using this social app among men and women in 2012-2013. The second bar chart shows the percentage between reasons for men and women.
In the first chart it is seen that the amount of users of Facebook by desktop had gone down from 2012 to 2013. However, the amount of users by phone had increased in 2013. Still, there were more users of Facebook by desktops than users by mobile phones in both years. The main reasons for using Facebook among males and females are sharing photos and videos, receiving updates, seeing funny posts and learning about the ways to help others. The percentage of women who have these reasons is almost higher in every aspects, but only the percentage for reason "receiving updates" between men and women is the same and has 39%.
Overall, the data shows that women think of using Facebook for these particular reasons more than men.
