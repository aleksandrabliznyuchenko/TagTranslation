While the first graph demonstrates whether the users changed in their preferences of a desktop or mobile version in 2012 and 2013, the second picture shows the proportions of men and women reported "sharing photos or videos", "receiving updates", "seeing funny posts" and "learning about ways to help others" as their main reasons to use this social network.
As can be seen from the upper chart, people used desktop version of Facebook more in 2012 but after a year the users of mobiles overweighted them. Apart from this, overall number of Facebook users decreased over the given period.
