There are a lot of things to consume nowadays. We can watch not only movies but also sport events for our entertainment. Some peoply argue that watching sports is just a waste of time. Others claim that this kind of activity can be very significant for entertainment of a person: it can be even his or her hobbie. I think that every person should decide what he needs by himself. If this human gets pleasure from watching sports, we cannot say that it is a waste of time. I can disagree with this statment because everything in this world is connected with personal experience. If one person does not like sport at all, that does not mean that all activities connected with this (like watching sport events on TV or at live sport events) are a waste of time. Some people can relax by doing such kinds of activities sitting on the coach with some tasty food. Others can consider it as a hobby: going to the stadium to watch football or hockey. You can also spend this time with your friends and make new ones because of the same interests.
On the other hand, you can do some more useful activity for yourself. For example, you can read a book, you can watch some online courses instead of football. Or you can do something good for the society in which you live like go and plant trees in your town. However, everything is based on personal prefences of a human. Someone can get money from making sport predictions - for this he or she needs to watch sport events. For someone else it is a recreation experience to accumulate strength because a human wants to forget all troubles and worries that he or she has and let the mind relax.
In conclusion, I want to say that we cannot claim that this activity is a waste of time bacause it differs from person to person. If he or she gets something from this (e.g. good tome with friends and family, pleasure from wathing strategies played by the teams that a person is watching) it is not a waste of time.
