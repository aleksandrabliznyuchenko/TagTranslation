There is a believe that enjoying sport events is useless. In what follows, I am going to express my opinion and state that watching sport events is both useful and wasteful use of time. Events, like soccer or MMA, can be seen as entertainment. Watching a football match can serve as relief or leisure for an individual. It is especially relatable in the case of hard-working people (factory workers). In Russia, these comprise a big share of football fans. It is supposed that watching sports is even more than just a relief for them - it may be seen as a meaning for life, for there are fans in Russia who travel all over the country to watch their team playing live. This dedication gets even deeper, as football fans organize fan clubs, web-pages, internet forums. By all these means, a new culture is comprised.
Despite the existence of fan culture, there are still ways to spend time more useful than simply watching others doing sport activities. Obviously, one can do sports him- or herself. Undoubtedly, physical activity, such as jogging or weight lifting, can bring more benefit than watching live match with a bottle of beer and snacks. Moreover, physical training is thought of as a relief measure itself. I can share my own experience and claim that jogging assists me in dealing with stress that is mainly caused by a large workload. Perhaps, factory workers may also go to gym in order to relax after a hard day at work.
In the end, I would like to restate my opinion and say that watching sports can be the most valued thing in one's life, the only relief, while it can also be replaced by a better activity - doing sports.
