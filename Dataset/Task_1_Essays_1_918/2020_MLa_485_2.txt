In the modern globalized social environment, there are plenty of ways to spend one's free time. Enjoying sport events is one of these ways. While some people like to occasionally spend their time watching sports, others claim that this is completely useless.
I am inclined to believe that watching sports is a wonderful way to entertain yourself, get inspired and have some rest. To begin with, there is a great variety of sports to enjoy today, from boxing to skiing. There for sure will be at least one activity that a person would enjoy watching. For example, I was thrilled by figure skating ever sinse I was I child. Never having the opportinity to skate myself, I fould an inspitarion in young figure skating champions performing on live TV. The grace of their movements and their devotion to this sport always amazed me.
Furthermore, watching sports is a good opportunity for a family to get together and spend some time with each other. This is a great thing to do in front of a TV, but even better when people have an opportinuty to go to the live sporting event. Even though some members of the family may enjoy this particular sport less than others, hearing the crowd cheer and seeing sportsmen in real life can get anyone excited. This effect gets even stronger if you are watching competitive game like hockey or some kind of a sport competition like the Olympic games, because you can choose a particular team of sportsmen and experience a wide range of emotions cheering for their success.
To sum up, I truly believe that watching sports are not a waste of one's time, because of the emotions, inspiration and experiences it gives to people.
