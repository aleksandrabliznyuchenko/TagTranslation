There is an opinoin that watching sports on TV ot live in not a plesant way to spend your time. However, my position is that it is a nice way to spend your time and i disagree with that people because of several reasons. You can have fun with friends or just follow your favorite team all alone.
Firstly, watching sports is not just about sports but also about people with whom you are at the moment. For example, watching a fotball game at home is a great oppportunity to have a good time with friends. You may even not be the fans of the specific kind of sport but you still will be having a nice time enjoing the company of each other.
Secondly, sport is a thrill. It is a very special feeling when you go to see the game on a big stadium. Crowd screams, fans beat the drums and many people in the same place create a very unic atmosphere which brings you joy and anxientment. This is one of the resons why sport is so popular and people from all ober the world keep to visit thousands of games every year. I assume that not only the feel of crowd make sport games so popular and joyful, but also the competition people observe there and beeing part of. For example, from ancient times football was a competitive game and Indians were playing football not for a regular prize but for their own lives, as far as, losing team was entierly executed.
All in all, there may be dozens of other reasons why sports is a good think to watch, but i mostly prefer to do it due to the good time i spend with my friends and the sense of competitons such games brings to me.
