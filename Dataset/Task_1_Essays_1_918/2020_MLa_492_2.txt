Some people believe that watching sports do not have any practical implementations and the time spent can be perceived as a wasted. I personally disagree with that statement and in what follows I am going to explain why.
First of all, it is a normal situation that people tend to have different preferences in spending their free time. Various types of leisure activities exist in the nowadays society. People of different personalities may spend their day-off in diverse manner in order to satisfy their needs. Therefore, if person is interested in sports, watching a football match is a great way to have a rest.
Secondly, such an activity as watching sports might also have learning purposes. Professional players usually watching live-translations, TV matches and real-life games in order to improve their skills and gain new knowledge. It is a common practice for competition teams to evaluate each other strategies and tactics analyzing previous game recordings.
Thirdly, watching sport games could be the group activity, then people can spend time together sharing interests. For example, my father and his friends always watch football games of Zenit team together in a bar.
In a conclusion I would like to note, that there is a great number of arguments proving that watching sports is not a time-wasting activity. It has a lot of purposes including recreation and learning.
