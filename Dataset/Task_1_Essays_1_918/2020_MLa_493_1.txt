The first graph gives us the information about the use of Facebook in March 2012 and a year later. The main feature that can be seen is that usage of Facebook via desktop almost did not change, while the number of mobile phone users in March 2013 outvalues March 2012 almost twice higher.
The second graph is about the gender distribution (women / men) among different reasons for using Facebook. All four bars of females are higher than the ones of males that helps to conclude that the social reasons (sharing photos and learning about ways to help others) and the entertainment reason (seeing funny posts) are more represented in the population of females than of males, while for receiving updates the numbers (the percentages of users among females or males) are the same. Overall, it may suggest that Facebook as a platform is used differently considering gender, by inferring from the graph of main reasons to use Facebook we can say that for females it is a bigger chance that some woman uses Facebook for social reasons than for males etc.
