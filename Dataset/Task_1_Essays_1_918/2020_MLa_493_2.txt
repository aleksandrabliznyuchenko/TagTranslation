SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT WATCHING SPORTS (EITHER ON TV OR AT LIVE SPORTS EVENTS) IS A WASTE OF TIME. I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE STATEMENT. THE FIRST REASON FOR ME TO SAY THAT WATCHING SPORTS IS NOT USELESS IS THE FOLLOWING: IT DOES CONTRIBUTE TO SOMETHING USEFUL. IT MAY THAT BY WATCHING SPORTS YOU DO NOT PRODUCE ANYTHING MATERIAL OR MAKE YOURSELF STRONGER, BUT YOU DO RELAX. NOT EVERY ACTIVITY MAY BE MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT OF GOODS IT PRODUCED, SOMETIMES IT MAY MORE USEFUL NOT TO DO ANYTHING SO THAT IN THE FUTURE YOU WILL HAVE MORE ENERGY TO SPEND ON SOMETHING MORE MEANINGFUL. BUT OF COURSE AS FOR EVERY ACTIVITY IT IS BETTER NOT TO BE EXTRA, NOT TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME, SO THAT THE MARGINAL UTILITY IS NOT TOO SMALL. THE SECOND REASON IS THE FOLLOWING: FOR SOME PEOPLE WATCHING SPORTS MAY BE USEFUL. WATCHING SPORTS IS NOT ALWAYS ABOUT DUMB SITTING IN THE COACH, SOMETIMES IT IS A MENTAL ACTIVITY. FOR INSTANCE, AN OBVIOUS EXAMPLE WOULD BE CHESS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS ANY SPORTS WITH STRATEGY. EVEN IN FOOTBALL WITH THE CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE OF THE THEORY YOU CAN SEE THE PATTERNS OF THE PLAYERS' MOVEMENT, WHAT THEY SHOULD DO AND SHOULD NOT DO. ALL OF THIS IMPROVES BRAIN, MAKES THE THINKING MORE INTENSE AND FLEXIBLE. THE FINAL REASON: IT IS A PLEASURE. USUALLY PLEASURE IS NOT A WASTE OF TIME. I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE THAT IT IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT REASONS TO LIVE. THERE ARE OF COURSE SOME OF THE OPPOSITE REASONS (THE REASONS WHY WATCHING SPORTS IS USELESS). THE FIRST IS BETTER EXEMPLIFIED WITH A PICTURE OF A FAT OLD MAN SIPPING BEER BENGE-WATCHING TV SHOWS. FOR SOME PEOPLE WATCHING SPORTS (EVEN IN STADIUMS) IS A DEGRADATION. BUT EVEN IF IT IS, IT IS NOT BECAUSE OF WATCHING SPORTS AS SUCH, BUT BECAUSE OF THE PERSONS. ANYTHING CAN BE USED EITHER FOR GOOD OR BAD. ANOTHER OPPOSITE REASON IS VIOLENCE. I DO AGREE THAT OFTENTIMES SPORTS ARE A REPRESENTATION OF TOXIC MASCULINITY, BUT IT IS A REASON AGAINST PATRIARCHY, NOT AGAINST WATCHING THE SPORTS. WITH THE RIGHT ATTITUDE AMONG PEOPLE TO EACH OTHER WE WOULD NOT SEE HYSTERIC CROWDS IN THE STADIUMS AND THE FIGHTINGS FOR THE BEST CLUB. TO CONCLUDE, I WOULD TO STATE THAT EVERY PERSON HAS THE RIGHT TO HAVE HIS OWN OPINION. THE MAIN THING IS TO COOPERATE AND LISTEN TO EACH OTHER. WATCHING SPORTS AS SUCH NOT GOOD OR BAD, BUT FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE IT HAS DIFFERENT CONNOTATIONS, SO IT IS ALWAYS THE MATTER OF HOW WE KNOW EACH OTHERS' BACKGROUNDS. FOR ME IT IS A BIG PLEASURE TO WATCH A GAME WITH MY FRIENDS, DISCUSSING WHO WILL WIN AND WHY ONE PLAYER IS BETTER THAN ANOTHER. FOR OTHERS THIS EXPERIENCE MAY BE LESS NORMAL OR ENJOYABLE AND IT IS NORMAL.
