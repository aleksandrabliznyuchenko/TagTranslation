Nowadays, sports is a huge entartainment industry. Millions of people are looking forward a new sports season, buy tickets beforehand on games to see it live. However, some people beleive that it is just a meaningless hobby. Pesonally, I do not agree with this statement.
People, who think that we should not watching sports, argue that it is better for us to do sports by ourselves and keep fit instead of sitting on a coach in front of the TV with a can of pepsi and cheaps. What is more, it is often provided with money losses, because firstly, tickets on sports games of world famous football team, for example, can be quite expensive. Secondly, when you are already on a stadium, it is almost impossible not to buy a special clothes of your favorite team or a sportsman.
On the other hand, sports fans is a big community with their own culture, uniting poeple. The time of the game, when a lot of different people from all over the world come together to the stadium to just watch others playing, magic is happening, because they all become one. All the problems and differences between them go away at least for the two hours of the game. How can it be bad? Several years ago, when the world football chempionship was held in Russia, I saw it by myself. It was a great international holiday of sports. When I look at my father, who is a big fan of hockey, experiencing the full range of emotions from sadness to complete joy and pride, I cannot say that watching sports is a waste of time. To sum up, watching sports as a hobby can have some financial disadvantages and we should not forget to do exercises. Nevertheless, sport is not only great to do, but watch as well since it makes people more friendly to each other.
