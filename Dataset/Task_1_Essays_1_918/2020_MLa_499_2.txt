There is an opinion that watching sport is a useless time-spending and many fruitful alternatives exist. Personally, I agree with this statement though some noteworthy advantages ought to be noted.
Firstly, I would like to say that watching sports events is quite a good way to relax after a busy day. In this case, you do not need to do anything except for laying on a sofa and enjoying other people competing. This can also be useful for actual sportsmen for they might obtain knowledge by analysing master-level players techniques.
However, such activity has tonnes of the drawbacks. First of all, a person who tends to spend their time on watching sports may shift to more profitable alternatives, for instance, watching a movie or reading a book. Secondly, it is much better to do sports rather than to watch it. What matters, those who are fond of sitting in front of a TV usually forget about the necessity in physical activity. They start to "mildew" without going outside although their point of interest is sports. Another issue related to the mentioned activity is that sports watchers may become envy or even depressed after seeing successful fitted sportsmen. Consequently, this can result in permanent bad mood and lowering self-confidence which may be striking for a person.
To summarise, I would like to note that regardless of some negligible pluses, watching sports can hardly be labelled as the best way to spend your time. Moreover, it may lead to sad consequences from the lack of self-development to actual problems with health.
