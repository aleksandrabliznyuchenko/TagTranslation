Nowadays lots of people argue about watching sports in different ways. Is it a real waste of time. I personally think that it trully is. In my essay I am going to give reasong for that.
Watching sport on a tv or in real life takes a lot of time and preparation, because you should at least find spare time to watch the play, buy a ticket in case it is a live sport event, and prepare some food for such a long a long event. Moreover, this takes a lot of time, usually plays last for several hours, during them you could have done something useful.
The second reason against watching sports is that you sit on a chair or a sofa for quite a long time at the same place, so it results in poor health, due to consumption of fizzy drinks and beer alongside with snacks, obesety and worsens blood circulation in your body, istead of this, you could have done some sports.
The next reason is that usually all the tickets are quite expensive if you decide to visit a life event, so it hurts your budget, but if you decide to stay at home watch the play, you can easilly distract you homemates and relatives by shouting and screaming. At the same time it is not good for your throat!
At the same time, some people consider watching sports joyful and pleasing, due to emotion and atmosphere, their point of view has a place in today's world, but I do not agree with it.
To sum up, comparing all the pros and cons of watching sports, brings me again to an idea, that I personally think it is a real waste of my personal time, so it is not worth seeing.
