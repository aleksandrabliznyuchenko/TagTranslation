Sports have always been strongly connected with entertainment. Whether it was the Olympic games in ancient Greece, or the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, sport competitions never failed to concentrate the attention of a considerable number viewers. Despite the undoubtable success of sport events in entertaining the general public some people believe that watching is not worth the time. First, viewing sports has long ago become a tradition in a vast amount of families. It is a way of spending time together that suits both parents and children. This is especially evident in the USA, where fathers take their children to baseball games, just like their parents used to take them. Moreover, usually many generations in a family a likely to support the same team as part of the tradition. This bring them closer together and strengthens family relations.
In addition, for the majority of people interested in a certain sport it is the best way of taking first steps in mastering the sport itself. Obviously, if an athlete is performing on such a level to be apart of a televised sports event, they have enough expertise and experience. Which means watching them do their job can be of great help in learning about the sport and a way of perfecting your own abilities. Many great athletes learned their craft by watching their childhood idols. For instance, Lionel Messi, one of the best football players that of recent times, has learned by watching the Argentinian football legend Diego Maradona play.
In conclusion, I believe that watching sports is a great way of bringing people together and learning new skills, which means that the time spent is totally worth it.
