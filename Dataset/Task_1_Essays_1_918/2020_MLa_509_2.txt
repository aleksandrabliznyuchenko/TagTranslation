Watching sports is a popular entertainment among people. However, some believe that it is just a waste of time. I think that even if watching sports is not a very productive activity, it is a valid way to enjoy free time. Hence, it can not be a waste of time. There are obvious reasons for people to degrade watching sports events. Firstly, some people say it is better to play sports than watching others play it. It may be true in some ways, but I do not quite agree with such statement. Playing sports is actually important, because it improves health. However, watching sports may bring people a lot of positive emotions, relieve their stress and help to relax, which is also good for health. In addition, I believe that sometimes following sports events may encourage people to join sports teams, start doing exercises and improve their body shape and health.
Moreover, watching sports is a collective activity that greatly bring people together. Sports matches or Olympics often bring people much more emotions and even adrenalin than movies or TV shows. It is known that people experience a lot of emotions while watching sports even if they are not sports fans. These feelings easily unite families, friends and even strangers during watching games or competitions on TV or live. How can some call it a waste of time if it improves relationships between people? In my opinion, it is a valid reason to spend time watching sports.
Overall, people may consider watching sport a waste of time and advise other to play sports instead. However, they do not realize that watching sports improve health by bringing many exciting feelings and relieve stress. In addition, such experiences unite people and bring them closer to each other.
