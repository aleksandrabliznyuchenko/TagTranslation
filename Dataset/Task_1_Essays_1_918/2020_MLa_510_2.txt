It is common version theat wathing sports on TV or in real life is useless way of spending time. I fully disagree with this point of view.
In my opinion, observing sports have many positive sides. Fist of all, sitting in front of TV with good football match is one of the types of entertienment, some people need to have some sort of rest like this after difficult week. It helps to emotionally release yourself. Secondly, whatching sports could very effectively help you in educations of this sport. You can find out many usefull tricks of some concrete players or powerfull strategy of the hole teams. Comentators during the sport events help adience with describing some key points of rules and implementation of new technologies. Therefore, after waching some tournaments you will get enough basic knowledges about esessential points of this sport. Thirdly, watching sport, especially at live sport event, is nice way for proffesional sportsmen to get ready for their competitions. They will become ready for other players or the concrete place of holding the tournament. Moreover, in fact it is one of the most interesting ways to lerning a new language. Personally, I like watching NBA, but there is no russian translations, so I was forced to learn English and watch the foreign one. Finally, every sport translates not only the game to the audience but the way of healthy thinking. Watching succesful players motivates doing sport by yourself. Also, the important moment of present world is that sports stands against rassism and shows how people of different nations can work in one team.
In conclusion, I want to point that other people could find something else usefull personally for them in watching sport. So, this type of spending leassure time could not be teated as a waste of time.
