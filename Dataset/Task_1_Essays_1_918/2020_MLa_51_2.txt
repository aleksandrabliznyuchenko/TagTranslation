In the beginning, I would like ti say that everyone has his own favourite way of spending free time. Someone likes to watch games in real life or on TV, others like to play sports rather than watch it. There is no right or wrong, as this is very individualistic qestion. Some may call for certain game events for months or even years.
I wouldn't agree that watching sports is a waste of time, as I find it wery stress relieving and this is exactly what you need in the end of the day.
It is also a very uniting, as when your whole family gathers in the living room and watches the game that everyone was waiting for.
Nowadays, when no one finds time to spend with their family, such games bring family together at least for few of hours or even more.
In addittion to that, for instance, for me wathing sports on tv or on internet bring me knowledge about game players and about the whole game itself.
I educate myself more and i find it very useful as i try to bet on the games if i know the game players well. So, the sports events and games that are available for everyone can even bring real money, if you know how to use what you see.
On the contrary, many people say that watching sports is a waste of time and its useless but it depends on the personal preferences. For some people reading a book is considered to be a waste of time, but in the same time it doesn't make the books least attractive to us.
In conclusion, i can surely say that watching sports can be a very useful process or an useless waste of time, depending on the way that you see it and how you do it. Speaking for myself i find it very interesting and i think if something brings you pleasure, then it can't be considered as a waste of time.
