The suggested charts describe some key characteristics of the Facebook audience. The first graph is a bar chart dedicated to the shift that happened in a relation to the devices people use to appear in the social network. The number of desctop users declined a little in a year after March of 2012, while the overall amount of mobile users increased on approximately 40 millions in the same period and become close to 100 millions. The second chart summarises 4 main reasons to visit Facebook and differentiates users by their gender. All in all, it is possible to say that women pronounced more reasons than men as the percentages for 3 out of 4 categories are bigger for their group. Notably, the equal shares of males and females (39%) has called "receiveing updates" a major reason to use the social network. The most popular variant among the groups is the content sharing: females get 54% for it what is the highest value in a graph. As for the weakest reason, respondents have shown relatively low response rate for the "learning about ways to help others"; it is only 25% and 35% for males and females respectively.
