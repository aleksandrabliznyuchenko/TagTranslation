Nowadays sport is a part of all peoples life. We listen that we should do sports to be healthy and pretty. Not all people love doing sport and they prefer watching sports game on tv or at sports events, while others think that it is waste of time. I do not agree with the statement that watching different sports are waste of time. Firstly, when you watching sports online or at live events you get pleasure emotions, and it is very healthy for our body and brain. People can relax during this time spending, do not think about their problems and just enjoy. Secondly, thanks to watching sports person can learn a lot of information about this sport and broad his horizons. Person will learn more and he will more confident. Moreover, this kind of time spending help avoid you negative emotions.
Nevertheless some people think that this kind of spending your activity is a waste of your valuable time. People can do sports theirselves and it will be more useful and more healthy for person that only watching. What is more, some people think that after watching online games people become nerve, because they suffer for their favourite teams and they are not always win.
In conclusion i would like to say that is watching sports is a really good idea for all people. There are a lot of benefits: you can relax, forget about your problems and enjoy games of your favourite team. I suppose that watching games wherever you want do not a simple waste of time, because people learn new information - it is education. People are happy and they get positive emotions and for me this is the main topic.
