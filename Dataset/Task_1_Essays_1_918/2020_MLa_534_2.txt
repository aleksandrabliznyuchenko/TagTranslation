Many people nowadays argue about the phenomenon of watching sports on television or at live matches. Certain individuals state that it is a completely useless activity, while others disagree. I am of the opinion that watching sports is a good and vital way to spend your time. In this essay I am going to prove my opinion.
First of all, watching sports broadcasts or live events can bring a huge amount of positive emotions to viewers. Whether a person is a big sports fan, or just a commoner, sports matches are almost always extremely exciting to watch. because of the many reasons: quick pace of the game, teamwork (if it is a team sport, such as basketball or footbal, for example), a battle between teams and\or participants for the main prize. That factors bring people together, forming a friendly community of sports fans, which then forms into a ritual of big tournaments, fan participation, fan art, fan culture and so on. However, even if a person is not integrated in the fan group of some team, it can also be quite entertaining to watch the live show.
Secondly, viewing of sports events and shows can give a person a huge boost to motivation, if the viewer is involved in the sport, that he or she is watching. Spectating professional athletes, who dedicated their life for one special sport activity, and who mastered their work to the highest degree, will most likely inspire younger and less experienced people to go higher and develop their skills, or maybe even come up with a new approach for existing sport. That is very common in skateboarding culture, for example.
To sum up, I think that watching sports is a good thing for many people, because it gives a lot of positive emotions, unites people and gives them motivation to progress.
