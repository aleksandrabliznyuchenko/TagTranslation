It is often argued that if you spend your time on watching some sports, it is always looked as an unneccessary thing. I completely disagree that watching sports is a waste of time and think it depends on situation.
First of all, there are people who do professionally sport or someone who only starts and chooses some kind of sport. In other words, when you are in sport for the long period of time you should watch for other sportsmen to learn something. For example, tennis players who instantly watching for new ideas, methods and styles of playing on court will successfully develop or if we talk about the people who begins to watch they have possibility to compare different types of sport and take a minimal information to choose the most favourable variant. So it is very important for this people to check the sitaution in sport for their own purpose.
Secondly, watching sport can give some significant life lessons. Generally, everobody can teach from the famous people who achieve the success by hard work, through their fears and non-confidence. I mean, there are many situations which you can learn before you met it in your life and also it is a good opportunity to work on yourself immeditely.
To conclude, i strongly believe that watching sport isn't a waste of time because it is crucial for sportsmen and for common people if it will be used correctly and wisely.
