It is argued by some that visiting sports events or watching them on tv is useless. I disagree with this statement, and in this essay, i will state the reasons for my view.
First of all, if we perceive going to sports events or gathering around the TV to watch a football match as an activity to spend time wint friends, it is incredible to say that it is a waste of time. As a result of this experience, you get plenty of positive emotions, collect shaed memories, and have time with your closed ones. After all, watching is just an exuse to be with people you miss and love.
Another reason for my position is that sport by itself is an incresdibly motivation and encouraging thing. When people have results, they want to move on, develop further and further. Sports events and TV- translations influence the same way on viewers. they awoke feelings of justice, pride, euphoria and joy for the victory. That is why people with notable sensitivity watch moves about athletes, where it is possible to follow their life story and empathy them. According to this argument, i would say that watching sports events and its recordings are not useless also because it awakes great feelings into people.
In cobclusion, i totally disagree with the opinion
