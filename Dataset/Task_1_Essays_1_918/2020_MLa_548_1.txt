The first chart shows us the use of Facebook. In march of 2012 year more people use Facebook on desktop, but in march of 2013 year Facebook is more used in mobile phones. There was a dramatic fall from more then 140 users to only 60. Users on mobile phone fall too from 130 to 100.
The second chart shows us reasons for using Facebook. Between women the most popular reason to use it is sharing photos/videos there and the leas popular reason between man and women is learning about ways to help others. Men line were the highest in receiving updates and sharing photos and videos too. Seeing funny posts in Facebook is more prefered by women then men. Receiving updates is common between both genders.
To sum up we can see the tendency of people to use Facebook more on mobile phones, maybe because it is more convinient to check it when you are in a hurry and not at home or work. Moreover desktop becoming less and less popular, they are big and expansive. When mobile phones are small, we always can take them with us and check everything we need there.
