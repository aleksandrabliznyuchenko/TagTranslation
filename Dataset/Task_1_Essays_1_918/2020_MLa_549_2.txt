Although some people think that there is no reason of watching sports games, I tend to think that it could have some advantages. The following essay contains the pros of watching sports.
In my opinion, there are particular benefits of going to the sports matches or watching them on TV. Firstly, it can be seen as an entertainment. It is no surprise that some people love watching it at the end of the day or at weekends. After a long day of working or studying people may want to relax and forget about routine by watching other people compete. Secondly, this activity may have a good impact on person's world perception. As he/she watches other people becoming legends and champions this may be a good motivation for him/her of wanting to be the same. Being good at sports makes people stronger and healthier.
I can also add that watching sports is a wonderful way of team-building or cultural integration. Fans share same emotions during the game whether their favorite players winning or losing. For example, there was a huge World Cup championship in Moscow in 2018 when people from all over the world came here to watch games from the stadiums, bars, restaurants and parks. Even if they were against some teams, all foreigners and Russians celebrated victories together (especially at the Nikolskaya street).
Taking everything into consideration, watching sports games on TV or actually being there in real life can be taken as a good way of entertainment which help people relax. It is also a form of motivation which is good for health and it is some kind of team-building which sometimes may lead even to the whole cultural integration.
