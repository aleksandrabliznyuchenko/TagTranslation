It is not a sectet that there is disscusion about watching sports. Some people believe that it is a complete waste of time, their opponents claim it has many benefits. It my opinion, watching sports is not a waste of time or energy.
First of all, watching sports leads to doing sports. For example, many people who like football matches are fond of playing it in real life. Moreover, watching sports leads to economy growth. All TV chanels and sport stadiums sell advertisement for big companies and taxes from their revenue make national economy stronger and less vulnerable. And the most import reason for is that people have fun while watching sports. They get possitive emotions that could be given simply by the winning of their favorite team.
However some people claim that during that time a person could do something useful. There is two problems of this statement. First one usefulness is very vague idea. Something useful for you could be harmful for your friend. The second problem that people have the right to spend their free time in any way they want to unless it bothers other people.
In conclusion, watching sports for some people is a waste of time and energy, but for many others it gives so many benefits and positive emoutions. Watching sports has so many advantaged that it is unreasonable to call it a waste of any type
