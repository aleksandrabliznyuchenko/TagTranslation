Watching sports became a very popular way of spending time nowadays. Some people think that it is a waste of time, but I can only partly agree with their opinion.
I believe that there are plenty of things to do in our lives, and the time for them is limited. For example, most people work a lot, and do not see their families very often. As for me, spending time with relatives is most important than watching sport, because we need to take care of them and support them. Also, if people have free time, I believe that it is necessary to spend it for education. There are a lot of different online- courses nowadays, which are free and available for everyone. It is better to spend an evening gaining some new knowledge than watching a sport event, because it can not only make one more educated, but also can lead to better job and higher salary. What is more, sitting all the evening infront of the TV screen can be dangerous to one's health because people need to move more to keep fit. Also, watching sport is associated with beer and unhealthy snacks such as chips, and a bad habit of consuming these food can make person overweight, which can also lead to other serious diseases.
However, there are some advantages of watching sports, too. For example, today people spend a lot of time searching the net and using social networks. Going out with friends to see a sport event provide people an opportunity to face-to-face communication, and also sometimes it can be even beneficial for their health, because some events, for example, football, are usually held in an open air. As a result, people can relax after their duties and daily routine and enjoy the company of friends.
All in all, there are some advantages of watching sport, but also it can bring some drawbacks, which can lead to bad consequences.
