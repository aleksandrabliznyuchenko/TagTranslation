Sports programmes are really popular all over ther world. Basketball, footbool, box or hockey on a TV or as a live sport event often make a sold out. There is on opinion that it is a greate way to spend a time, relax and take an emotions but my point is that wathing sport events is a waste of time. In this essay i will explain my opinion.
So, I say earlier watching sport events is a waste of time. Firstly, because it is better to your health do spots than to watch it. Watching sport games usually supporting by unhealthy snacks as chips, hot-dogs and others. For examle, football is strongly associated with a beer. People only seat, eat and drink something and whatch the game. It is a right way to got problems with their health. The time that man spend on whatching for examle basketball will be better to spend playing it on the open air.
Moreover, if you want to relax and to have a rest after a long hard-working day watching sport games is not the best idea. Your favourite team can loose and it you will sad and full of stress. It is too emotional way to spend your free time. A lot of stress on the work and than stress while doing hobby is bad for the first to mental health, for the second to a physical. To have a greate and really helpfull rest you can make for yourself a bath with a bubles, read a book or whatch romantic comedy that usually gives pleasent emotions.
Taking everything into a consideration, I argee that watching sports on TV or as live events is a waste of time. People can spend their on something else that can improve their physical on mentional health. Wathing sports is full of unhealthy things like beer and snacks and at the same time it is too stressfull to use it as a way to have a rest.
