Nowadays more and more people are fond of sports. While some people claim that there is no use in watching sports, others disagree.
In this essay i am going to explain my position on this controversial issue.
Personally, I do not agree with the above mentioned opinion and I am convinced that watching TV programmes or live events gives great opportunity for people who keen of sport to be the part of this community. First of all, programmes about sport illustrate great example of determinate people with strong character, who encourage lots of people to start living more healthy. It results in increase in the amount of active people, who do exercises and carry about their shape. Hence, population become healthier.
Another argument in favour of my position is that sport industry is beneficial for the worldwide community as there is plenty of events such as FIFA, Olympic games, Worldwide championship or competition that have positive influence on people's relationships from all over the word. Worldwide events are hosted in many countries and such competitions become a national celebration as fans, famous sportsmen, journalists, celebreties and other people start travelling around the world in order to be the part of this unique event. Hence, people learn more about culture of other countries and practise foreign languages.
Overall despite the fact that some people claim that watching sport is not useful, I am convinced that everything is good in moderation. Consequently, there is no harm in just watching programmes about sport as long as there are still some people who really do sposts.
