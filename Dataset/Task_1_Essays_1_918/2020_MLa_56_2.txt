People have been arguering about the topic of advantages and drawbacks of watching sport channels and live events for more than a decade for now. I personally consider the mentioned kind of activity as the one which is not contributing to anyone's development at all.
First and foremost, watching TV has been proved to worsen humans' eyesight. It is not arguerable, that watching some constant action happening on the TV screen might be very addicting, which also leads to tons of hours spent staring at the enemy of eyes' health - LED screens. Moreover, watching TV shows from the young age may even foster eyesight' deterioration to that extent, that the need to wear glasses will ari.e. Furthermore, I believe that sitting on the same place for hours, regardless of the location is facilitating to excessive weight and disabled muscles. In sharp contrast with doing their job sportsmen, spectators are similarly to zombies do not move and additionally consume much of fat and oily food. Consequently, watching sports leads to health troubles and obesity.
Finally, although some people might assert that watching sport events helps to educate yourself on sport's themes, I personally highly doubt it. Most of the spectators watch TV channels after hard working days, what is even worse - while being drunk. As a result, people are not only devising their knowledge and skills in sports but also threaten some other people's rest time. For instance, I am terrified to walk late in the evening after international football games, since I have seen so many murdered and injured people due to encounter with aggressive football fans.
To sum everything up, I would like to underline that it is better to do sports rather than to unconsciously watch it.
