Sport has become one of the outlets for the competitive part of humans' nature. However, there is an opinion that simply watching sports - no matter, from the comfort of your couch or shouting your favorite team's slogans from the stadium seat - is a waste of time. I respectfully disagree with such line of thought.
First of all, visiting a live sports event can become a source of excitement for a person. From my personal experience, watching a good match or an intense sparring between two sportspeople can "charge" and even inspire those who feel that their life is dull and boring. This effect works even when a person in question is not physically present, and personal visit can increase it tenfold.
Additionally, visiting sports events or just tracking the career of a sportsperson or a team can present one with an opportunity to connect with like-minded people, thus solving the ever-present problems of loneliness and abandonment. Fan clubs exist for that very reason, to allow people to connect with each other doing some things they enjoy.
Finally, watching the sport in any form may stimulate a person to finally start doing some sport on their own. Although they might never reach the heights of professional athletes, the work they put into their bodies will not go to waste. It should also be noted that they "might" never reach - a lot of famous sportspeople decided to choose this career because they were inspired by someone else.
In conclusion, watching and attending sport events is not as useless as it seems to be. It can allow one to feel new emotions, to find new friends and to improve their own health
