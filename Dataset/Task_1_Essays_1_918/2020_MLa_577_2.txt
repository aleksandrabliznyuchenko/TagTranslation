Nowadays some people say that spending free time watching sport games is pointless. I disagree with this statement because I am sure that is a very useful and enjoyable activity.
Firstly, some people that are playing sports are often fans of some sport teams. While watching sports they can learn some new tricks from their favorite players. This tricks can be used than by the watchers in real life. This improves their skills. For example, children that are playing football while watching sport games can follow with eyes their favorite player. Then on the training children can exercise and became better players. This happens always because watchers want to be like their favorite players.
Secondly, sport games also learn people cooperation and team spirit. Watching sport games with other fans of the favorite team is the most powerful thing that can be happen to someone. The point is that all of the fans support each other. They have same interests and thats why people can build a very strong friendship while watching sport games. As an example I can give one situation that happened to me. Once I was on the football play in Germany and was watching a match by my favorite football team. Near to me seat one girl that was supporting this team too. We talked to each other all game. Then we changed our numbers and we still are good friends.
In conclusion, watching sports is a good way of spending free time. Many people can learn something while watching sport games and some people can find good friends that have the same interests.
