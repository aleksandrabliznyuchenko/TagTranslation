There are some people who hold the opinion that watching sports is just killing time. I disagree with this point of view. in my opinion, watching sports can enhance bonding within communities and promote a healthier lifestyle.
First of all while you are watching it you can learn the rules of this sports. Secondly you can develop a team spirit at yourself, and later it will help you in different spheres of your life, for example in your job or in your family. Moreover, you can find some new friends, who likes watching some sports too and you can start going with them to the different sport events or maybe start training it one day. When people watch the game they are getting closer to people they do not even know, because they have common feelings and emotions, they look like a 'hobby family'.
The most important thing about watching sports is imitation. When people watch their favourite sports, favourite sportsmen, they want to be like them. Sportsmen like examples for teenagers. Kids, teenagers and adults adore sporting heroes and want to emulate their lifestyle. So we can say that watching sports promote healthy lifestyle for real. Important to mention, that while some sport events are held, people more likely start doing sports or going to gym, because everywhere translates how successful sportsmen are.
In conclusion, i would like to sum everything up and mentioned, that watching sports is not a waste of time. By watching sports you became healthier, because it instills healthy habits, also it helps find soulmates and it is just fun!
