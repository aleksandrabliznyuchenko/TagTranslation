Nowadays there is a common opinion that those who watch sports on TV or online are wasting their time. I believe, that whatching an event that you can not join or see in real life for some reasons is pointless.
Firstly, if you want to see the football match, but you have no money to buy a ticket, or the stadium is located far away from you, it seems to be an attractive opportunity to watch it online. But I am sure that it will not bring you true emotions, you just can not feel it the way you could feel it seeing the game in front of you, without TV screen. You should be surrounded by people with the same desire and interests, who can scream the words to support their favorite team. It is impossible to get this kind of experience watching game online. The only exeption I can name is The World Championship which is supposed to be watched online by millions of people.
Moreover, I know people who should watch the game carefully because they should analyse the actions of some football players in case they did something wrong, and this people watch an event from screen, where they can play back and make a screenshot if needed. But it is not about enjoing watching sports online, it is about their work.
To sum up, I am not really into watching sports on TV, but if this opportunity is available it means that there are still some people who use it.
