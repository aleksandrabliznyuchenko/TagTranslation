Nowadays, a lot of people believe that wathing any kind of sport on TV or at live events won't do any good. Some people think that watching sport is a good spending time and also it rather enjoyable. I agree with people who love watching sport and take pleasure from it.
On the one hand, i understand people who don't like this kind of activity and thinks it's not as useful spending time as it could be. This kind of people always have a lot of energy and don't like passive kind of interests, in their mind you can't be happy and succesful if you are not working 24/7. Probably, the also think that sport is rather borring relax time and there are always same rules and situations.
On the other hand, there are so much people who infiniti love that kind of landing time and to be honest it's closer to me and to my heart. First of all, rule of my life is "try to get more happy feelings and less negative", so if someone really love for example football why can't he watch this after hard working or studying day and get a lot of pleasure from it. In my opinion, if some time spending is not very useful but it makes you happy it's for sure not a waste of time. Also, there are some benefits from wathing sport, it's super inspiring and for example Mbape now is becoming superstar in football but 10 years ago he just started working hard because he was inspired with allknown Christiano Ronaldo and was Mbape was dreaming to become at least closer to his idol.
In conclusion, although i disagree with people who think that watching sport is a wasting time but i strongly believe that it doesnt matter what are you doing, the most important thing is getting good feelings and be happy because of it. So if people get pleasure from it let them do it.
