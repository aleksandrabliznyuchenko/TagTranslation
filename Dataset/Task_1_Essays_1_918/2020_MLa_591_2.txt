Some people hold the opinion that it is such a waste of time to watch sport. I disagree with my view. In my opinion, watching sports is a useful activity and has may benefits in its own.
First of all, watching sport is an excellent form of entertainment and for many, this is even a passion. It is a pleasure and way of relaxation for many and in most of the cases, people watch sports with others, which is a great way of socialising. I believe that watching sports on TV or at live sports events has become an event of communicating each other in many country, from many levels of community. However, spending hours after hours in front of a TV set to watch different sports without doing anything is not recommended.
However, watching sports in free time is considered as the best and safest of the options. Watching sports on TV can be the best experience to spend time with family and friends. Also, the sport lovers do not only get a chance to watch the most exciting competitions, but also get a chance to observe and learn about how teams, or players cope-up with the pressure, and make comebacks. These skills can be of immense help in real life, especially at workplaces.
In conclusion, I think every person should spend its free time as he wants. Some enjoys watching sports, others have their interesting as reading or physical training. Regardless, it should not stop us from our achievement and wishes.
