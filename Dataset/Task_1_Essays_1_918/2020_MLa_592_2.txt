It is argued that people do not need to watch different sports events because there are a lot of others benifisial deals to do. I absolutely support this point of view and I will try to prove it.
On the one hand, when you are watching sports programs you do not do any physical activities. Firstly, as usual you just seat on the sofa. Long-time seating can bring a lot of problems with back, body balance and eyes. Secondly, TV channels shows sport programs for all day and makes you forget about the time, with can be spent on more important things.
On the other hand, sport fans, who love watching this sorts of programs do not use any intellectual sourses. For example, while reading or writing people usually complete some thoughts and ideas in their heads.
