There are a lot of ways to spend your free time. Some people choose to take a nap, some of them do yoga and some of us prefer to watch sports on TV or go to live sports events. There is an opinion that the last option is a waste of time. I do not support this point of view and I will give the arguments in the following essay.
First of all, watching sports is a good way to acquire knowledge of the different cultures. Mostly, people prefer to watch competitions between different countries. Therefore, sport fans can discover cultural differences between people, study how to understand their language, notice fashion changes. For instance, The World Cup 2019 was the best opportunity for Russian people to see a lot of differences between Russian and foreign people.
Finally, as far as I am concerned, I strongly believe that nothing that makes someone happy is not a waste of time. People can have different hobbies and get various of useful skills or knowledge from it, so nobody can judge them for it. For instance, some people watch sports on TV after a long working day and it helps them to calm down and to avoid stress, so they work better the next day.
To sum up, there is always an option how to spend a day and people can choose whatever they want. Nothing is a waste of time if it brings something positive to the life. People can acquire knowledge from everything and from the watching sports too.
