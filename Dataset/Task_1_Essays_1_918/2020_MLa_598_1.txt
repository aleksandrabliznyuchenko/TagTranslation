You can see the charts which show changes in the use of Facebook from 2012 to 2013.
I would like to start from the first graph. The graph shows the amount of users who use desktop and mobile. In March 2012 we can see that the amount of desktop users were higher, nearly 150 millions, while in 2013 were almost 140 users. Compare this numbers to the march of 2013 we can say that in 2012 were little amount of people who use mobile phones. It became more popular in 2013. But in 2013 desktop still more popular than mobile phones. We can say, that mobile phones become more comfortable, so people prefer to use them more often, than in 2012.
Talking about the second graph, we can see the diagram of "reasons using facebook". This graph compare men and women. Looking at this diagram we may think that women are more active use facebook than men. We can see that in all sphere women is higher. Women more often sharing photos and videos, seeing funny posts, learning about ways to help others. I think, we can say, that for women facebook is a kind of place, where they can relax and get some positive stuff. Men less using facebook for fun. They use facebook as a news channel.
