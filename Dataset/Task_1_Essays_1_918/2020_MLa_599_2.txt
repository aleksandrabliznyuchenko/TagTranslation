It is populary believed that watching sports on television or in live is a time loss for people. I do not agree with this statement and sure that watching sports (either on TV or at life sports events) have good influence on people. The folowing essay explains my point of view and uncover it with examples.
To begin with, watching sports may help people while they will be doing sports in real life by their own. If people watch sports on television or in live, they may pay attention on the skills of professional players and try to take over their technique. For example, in the russian film "Ice 2" one of the main characters, a little girl Nadya, always liked watching figure skating champions with your mum, who was a talanted figure skater. After warching this sport on TV Nadya tried to do skating by her own to be like her mum.
Futhermore, watching sports (either on TV or at life sports events) for some people may be as a hobby. A lot fans all aroud the world watching sports because they are interested in them or to have some rest after a busy work. The community of fans is tremendous and they meet each other in different countries. For example, on the Football World Champion in Russia there were a lot of fans all around the world and there were one thinf that unite them all - sport.
To sum up, I would like to say that each person have an opportunity to chose their interests by their own and I do not think that any interest can be a waste of time.
