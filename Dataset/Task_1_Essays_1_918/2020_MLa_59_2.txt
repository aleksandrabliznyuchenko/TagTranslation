There is a common knowledge that watching sports is often referred to a waste of time. Other people believe this activity is absolutely worth spending time on. In my opinion, despite several benefits of rejecting live sports events or via TV, watching sports is one of the most amusing and entertaining ways of spending spare time. On the one hand, there is absolutely nothing bad in being keen on watching sports events. Firstly, it helps people escape everyday routine and difficulties. The majority of people like to dedicate their free time to some special and incredible event which may even bring some pride and amusement. Moreover, those who is falling for sports indeed, it is definetely possible to feel much more motivated and enthusiastic after the certain event. People from generation to generation have been told that watching and participating in sports events helps feel more energetic and enthusiastic, motivated and willing to do something as they would feel the energy of professional sportsmen and symphathize them.
On the other hand, many people still are certain about unnecessity of watching sports. This part of humanity believe sports is made up for doing it yourself and watching others doing has no effect on the person. doing sports, in their opinion, is a physical activity which is not possible to impact the watcher's skills and knowledge, so it is not the way of broadening the mind. In addition, sport events include too strong feeling of competition, harm, damage and even humiliation. Those sportsmen who could not win, they feel much frustrated and unworthy, and this awful mood easily translates to the watchers so they spend the rest of the day thinking of what happened.
To sum up, despite the strong vision of people who critisize watching sport events, I strongly believe it only has benefits like helping people relax, get rid of daily routine and problems, and also gives unbelievable emotions during the certain event.
