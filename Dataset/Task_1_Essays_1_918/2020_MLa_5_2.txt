People often argue about watching sports. In my opinion, even though watching and giving people arest, distraction from work and so on but ofhen they get too carried away and harm themselves spending so much time on TV and live sports events.
On the one hand, the watching sports is a good way to distract yourself and get relaxing. Someone relaxes doing sports, someone watching TV series, someone walks.. and I can't say that there is truly correct method. I think that everyone has different tastes and different understanding of the rest. A few years ago I loved to watch Footbool match, it gave me a lot of time to relax and think about something. But I alvays knew when I must stop doing "nothing" and start doing my business.
On other hand, this way of spending time can have bad consequences. If somebody can't stop and love it bigger than other things, he can stay a stuppid and will lay on his sofa all time. But if we talk about "wasted of time" only, for example, football: 11 billioners running around the football field and kicking the ball. What is this?
In conclusion, I think that everyone must spending his time how he wants, but! everyone must think about future and how the watching can influence for himself.
