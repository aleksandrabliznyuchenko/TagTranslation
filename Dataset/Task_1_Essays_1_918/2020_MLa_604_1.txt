The data above shows why and how people use Facebook.
First, we look into the chart that shows how usage pattern changed over the two years (March 2012 vs March 2013). Most importantly, we can note that the usage shifted from using the Facebook on Desktop to using the Facebook on mobile phones. Specifically, in March 2012 150 million people used Facebook on desktop while only 58 million people used it on their phones. In March 2013, the situation changed a lot with 98 million people using the platform on mobile, while the desktop usage grew very modestly.
The second chart paints a qualitative picture and shows how/why men and women use Facebook. The most evident differences between genders is photo sharing purpose. Interestingly, 54% of women claimed to have used Facebook to post pictures, while only 39% of men claimed the same reason. The second biggest differenciator was lerarning about ways to help others, with 35% of women claiming to do so, while only 25% of men claiming the same reason. Seeing funny posts was also another reason how genders differed from each other: 43% of women and 25% of men claimed this purpose. Interestingly, receiving updates was equally valuable for both genders at 39%.
Finally, the data shows an interesting picture of how and why men and women used Facebook in 2012 and 2013.
