Watching sports is considered as a waste of time by some people. I completely disagree with this statement. In my opinion sports programmes on TV or sports events are one of the most useful thing.
First of all, when people watch or go to sport events they prefer to go with their family or relatives. It means that this kind of enterteiment helps to collect all family and relatives and spend time together. For example, in many films watching sports on TV always demonstrates as an important part of family gathering during which they cook different dishes and have a communication about various tasks.
Secondly, many sport activities motivate people to led an active sportstyle in purpose to achieve the same shape or even to start a sport career. As many sportsmen have to training much, they look really fantastic and attract people's attention. For many viewers it can be a motivation to begin to do sport exercises. For young generation it can be a motivation to start a sport career. For instance, many famous athletics start their sport career after watching sports programmes on TV in young age.
To conclude, I would like to highlite that watching sports is a way to communicate with your family and a motivation for people to do sports activities.
