This often argued that watching sports programmes on TV or attending different sports events is useless. I completely disagree with this opinion and suppose that such way of spending your time can also be beneficial.
First of all, i believe that sports programmes on TV are very fascinating and exciting and can easily make people fall in love with sport. For example, children, who watch TV with their parents start showing interest in a particular kind of sport.
My neighbours are keen on tennis. They never miss championships. As a result their son not only watch these programmes with them but also went to a tennis school two years ago. He cannot imagine his life without tennis sport now The second reason why i disagree that watching sport is meaningless is that is really on unforgettable experience when you watch live sport events. It is not only an excellent form of entertainment but a great chance to socialize with ohter people, meet new friends and become a part of a world of sport.
My friends for example are fond of hockey match. i was so fascinated by the whole atmosphere that today i go to hockey matches regularly. it is my favourite kind of sport.
Finally, i am absolutely sure that just watching sport can also be beneficial, because not all people can physically indulge in playing sports, because of come diseases, So, for them, watching TV programmes or live matches can be the only way out. It is a uniqe chance to fell a part of community and avoid the depression and loneliness. A lot os former professional sportsmen become fans and attend different competitions regularly.
in conclusion i would like to stress the fact that people can show their foundness of sport in different ways. The arouments i have presented suggests that watching sports can have a positive impact on peoples lives. i am convinced that such a way pastime is realy rewarding.
