Nowadays nobody can imagine their life without watching sport. Some people think that its very useful and important part of our lifes, while others argue that its a waste of time. I strongly agree with the last viewpoint as there are a lot of argument in favour this position.
To beging with, watching different kind of sports help people to relax and forget about their routine problems. Moreover, its a great opportunity for those who do not have enough money to do this kind of sport but they can just enjoy how professionals do it. Although, sport viewers feel incredible emotions during the watching sport at the stadium and supportinf their favourite teams.
Pherhaps the strongest reason for the argument that watching sport is usless is that people in modern world are busy andthey can spend time more interesting and useful. For instance, go to museum, read a book or meat with their friends and just have a good time togheter. Another related argument is that people usually lead asedentary lifestyle and they do not have enough physical activity that is why they really need to do sports and as a result they will keep the body in good shape and have toned figure. In addition, British scientists identified that watching sports is negetivly effect on our brain and it would be much useful to read books about sports and the biography of famous sportsmens.
In conclusion, there is no doupt astrong case for watching sport but I believe that it is also wise to take account of the argument in favour the position that people have more interestinfg and useful deals than watching sports for many reasons.
