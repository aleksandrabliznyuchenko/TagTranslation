Nowadays the increasing of new technology helps people to make a dicision about activity which they can have in a free time after work or after university. People frequently use the hand-held devices, TV or laptops for these goals.
Some people claimed that it is useless to spend time waching sports on TV. I absolutely disagree with this point of view. Checking some tv programmes about sports has many pros and I try to proof It in my esssay.
To begin with, waching sports events can join all family members and It can be additional impulse to spent time together. For emample, when someone tryes to spread an emotions after a vital match, It is extremely important to support this positions and to demonstrate the same emotions. Also, because of high costs of tickets, only people with well-paid job can afford to go to the real sports event. Moreover, while people waching sports on TV, the motivation to go to the gym and to enhance the condition of the body is boosting.
One more example of good consequences after waching sports is maintaining the feel of patriotism. For instance, in 2018 was the international world cup and many public areas was full of people whos have a one vital goal to support their country.
To sum up, waching sports has many advantages which undoubtedly followed my arguments. Despite of the fact that some people argued that wathich sports in the TV screen is harmful. I support the position that watching sports helps people to be strong and motivated to start doing exersice, provides an opportunity to have a deep links between family members and also helps to unlarge the patriotic feelings.
