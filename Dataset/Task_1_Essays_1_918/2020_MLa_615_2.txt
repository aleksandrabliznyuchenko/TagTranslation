According to some people, spending time by watching sports is just wasting your free time. However, I absollutely disagry with this statement. In my opinion watching sports is very useful activity and has many benefits of its own.
First of all, watching sports is a great leisure time for both one and a group of friends or family. You can get together in the living room in front of the TV or go live to the stadium. In any case, you will have a great time. Secondly, watching sports can be a great motivator for the viewer. For example, you really like football and you support the Italian club Juventus where Cristiano Ronaldo plays. You look at his amazong game and try harder in training to improve your skills.
Finally, while watching the game, we can gain immense knowledge about it. Also, watching sports with our loved ones is a great opportunity to spend some quality time with them. And when you cheering together for your favorite team, it brings you closer.
In conclusion, watching sports in leisure time is a good way of spending time and for some people this hobby may even turn into a career. So, people should encourage their children to develop interest in sport by watching it and paricipating in it whenever possible.
