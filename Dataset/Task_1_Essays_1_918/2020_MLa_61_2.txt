A lot of people know that watching sports is a great pastime. Nevertheless, there are someone who says that such way of spending freetime is not as productive and useful. I tend to agree the first group's position.
First of all, watching sports is an excellent way to entertainment and spending freetime with family or friends. It is relaxing way to combine dinner or trip to bar with something recreational. Someone can chill and do nothing in front of TV, sometimes it is all that people want after the work. Moreover, it is good way to socialize with strangers who also supports your team. People usually go to see football, basketball and tennis matches with group of fans close to them in spirit, because everyone wants to share the joy of victory. These people become a family to each other.
On the contrary, a lot of people claim that watching sports events is only for lazy people who like to kill their time and that there is so many productive activities such as real sport. The truth is that instead of watching TV everyone could go outside and play football with real friends and at the same time train themselves. It is healthier than sitting on the sofa and eating crisps and cola.
Also often sports lovers do not see the edge of watching sports on TV. This can become an addiction like junk food or cigarettes. It is to easy to lost control of watching something exciting, in the sequel this may cause family quarrels.
In conclusion, I think sports it is good theme of discussing and spending time, but there should be limits. If person keep the balance, sport events never mess up somebody's life.
