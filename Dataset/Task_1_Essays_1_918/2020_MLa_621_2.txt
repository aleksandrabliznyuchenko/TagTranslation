This is not a secret, that there are a lot of people who say, that they are keen on sport. Such people can watch sports (on TV or at life events). But there are also some people, who think, that watching sports is just a waste of time. And I am agree with second type of people.
Firstly, watching sports is not doing sports. When you do sports, you make your body better, you stay healthy by doing soma exercises. Sport is for people, who carry about health. For example, when I am jogging in mornings - I burn many calories, and it makes my body fit, healthy and beautiful. It is a very good habit. And when somebody is watching sports on TV, he just seets and often eats some fat or fast food, and what is worse - this man can drink beer. So see we typicall sports watching lovers. I think, that by watching sports people often do some unhealthy things, which can influence on your life. Secondly, sports events can not make you smarter. You can waste so much time by watching sports, but you didn't know something new. To illustrate, by watching one basketball competitions you can read one book, which can help you to achieve your goal. To be honest, you can do anything, that can help you to have better educational and carreer chances or better lifestyle. This rule does not work only when your job is in the sports sphere.
To sum up, people can do watching sports, when they don't want to do something good for their lifes, and just want to watch spotrs with their bad habits. People who care about yourselfs want to feel healthy and smart, thei want to have better lifestyle.
