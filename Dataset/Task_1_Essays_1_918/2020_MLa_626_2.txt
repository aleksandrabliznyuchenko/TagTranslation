There is an opinion that people should not spend time on watching sport and they ought to use it more effectively. I can agree with this statement, because sport events take a lot of time, which can be spent learning or reading something. However, i also can disagree, because for some people watching and visiting sport events are kinds of relaxing or professional development.
From one hand, watching sports is a waste of time due to several reasons. During the translation of sport events there are many organisational moments, which are not interesting for viewers. For example, the preparation to competition. It often is broadcasted, how sportsmans train and get ready for the game or race etc. What is more, there is not necessity to watch sports because there is a big number of medias, which publicate the results of competitions and main occasions, happened during the competition. So, person is able to know all event details spending 5-10 minutes, not 2-3 or even more hours.
To the other hand, it is difficult to say that watching sports is a waste of time. First of all, it is the way to relax and escape from reality. During the game or race etc. people think about sportsmans, not about own problems. Moreover, for trainers and sportsmans this activity can have an impact on their professional development. In this way they observe technics and behaviours of successful athletes. Last but not least, watching sports is able to motivate people to change their shapes and lifestyles.
In conclusion, i would like to say, that i am not able to give my certain opinion on this topic. I think, that it depends on people. For somebody watching sports is a real waste of time, for other people it can be useful leisure activity.
