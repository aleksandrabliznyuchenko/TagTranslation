Watching sports can be very important for getting new friends, for including yourself to the special group. Also in can be important for somebody if he is a trainer or a sportsman but for other people it is not as inetersting as for them. To be honest, i agree with the statement that sitting infront of TV or on the football field and watching the game live is a waste of time. Firstly, instead of sitting and watching the process of the full game during an hour or more it will be more usefull to do something. I mean it is possible to watch the results of the game in the Internet, also it is possible to watch the recording of it with higher speed, and you can spend 10 minutes fot it alternatively to half an hour.
Secondly, it can be harmful for health. On the one hand watching on the stadium, mostly if there is very unexpected result of the game fans of loosing team can have an argument with fans of the winner team. By the way it is very dangerous because sometimes these people are drunk. On the other hand sitting at home and watching on TV, is not as harmful as live but when you are sitting with your family or friends, you always want to eat something, mostly it is not something health, for example snacks.
In conclusion, check the results and watch the recording of the game is more usefull because you can scroll it to any part, you can watch the same moment uncounted amount of time, so you don't need to spend much time for it. Also not watching the full process of the game or live won't stop you from getting emotions because you can also discuss it with with your friends of family.
