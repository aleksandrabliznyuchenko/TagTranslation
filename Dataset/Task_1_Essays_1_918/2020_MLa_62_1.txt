I would like to compare this graphs. On the first picture we can see the comparison of using the Facebook on the mobile devices and desktops in 2012 and 2013. As we see on the first two graphs the usage of the website with a desktop in 2012 was bigger than in 2013. The graphs show us that the usage of the Facebook with mobile devices is less than with desctops in both years. However the total usage of Facebook has decreased by 2013. In 2012 the higher point of using this website was more than 140 with desctop and the lowest was a little less than 60 with mobile devices. Therefore the top amount of users in 2013 was less than 140 on desktops and less than 100 on mobile phones. The other graphs show us the reason male and female users log in to the website. The most reasonable visit of the Facebook of men is sharing photos and recieving updates which is the same with female users. Women are using the website more often than men. The top reason of visiting the site is to share photos which is 54 percent. The only reason that is equal with men and women is sharing photos Using this graphs we can make a conclusion that the using of the Facebook has decreased by 2013 and that women use this website more than men.
