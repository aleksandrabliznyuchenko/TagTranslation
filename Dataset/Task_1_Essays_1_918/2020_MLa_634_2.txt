Today people watch a lot of TV and various programs, including sports broadcasts and competitions. Many people like to rest like this after a hard day, spend time with family or forget about problems at work. And spectators of sports programs often either themselves are engaged in different sports or were previously athletes, therefore they are attracted by such broadcasts. I think that watching sports events is very interesting, exciting and informative. Firstly, many former athletes are very passionate about their favorite sport, to which they have devoted part of their lives. It was their experience, their formation as individuals, self-development and search for themselves. They invested time and energy in this sport, so even after the end of their sports career it is important for them to follow sports events in this area. According to research, 90 per cent of former and current athletes watch on TV or at live, and not only there, sports events, Olympiads, competitions and up-to-date information in their favorite sport.
Secondly, watching sports programs, channels and performances captures and increases adrenaline in the blood. Many spectators love to watch fights, confrontations and competitions in various sports. It causes excitement, empathy, people root for their favorite team or athlete and wish them victory. And also many people bet on sports, which also increases the excitement and experience in the soul when watching sports events. Scientists claim that while watching sports on TV or in life, the adrenaline in the blood doubles in viewers.
In conclusion, I want to say that watching sports competitions and programs is not a waste of time. For many spectators it is emotions, empathy and personal experience through the participation of athletes.
