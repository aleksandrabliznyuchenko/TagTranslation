Many people think, that watching sports event in any ways is a complete waste of time. One the one hand there is an opinion that watching sport programme is useless spending of time, but on the other hand there is an opinion that watching sport events on tv or at live sport events can really interesting and productive. Personally i disagree with the statement about that watching sport is a waste of time. To my mind, watching sport is a very interesting way of spending time for the reasons given bellow.
First of all, i would like to say some words about watching sports events with family, friends and others. Me with my friends watching football events every sunday, it is a kind of tradition for us. When we watching this, we often talk to each other, wondering how everyone feel himself today. As you can see, football makes us to spend with each other more time and become closer.
Secondary, i want to tell about specific group of people who earn money with the different sports events. They bet their own money in special companies, for example, on win of one from both football teams. Such way of earning money became very popular during last several years. When someone bet his on money on the football event, watching of this event become a real interesting chalange because in the begening you never know who exactly will win or loss.
In conclusion i would like to say, that watching sport can be really interesting and productive way of spending time.
