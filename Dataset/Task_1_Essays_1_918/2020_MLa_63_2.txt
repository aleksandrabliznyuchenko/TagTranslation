Nowadays we have a lot of ways to watch sports like TV, internet, live events and etc. But some people believe that spending time to watch sports is a waste of time. To understand why they say that lets take a closer look in this point of view.
On the one hand we can use from 30 mins to 1,5 hours for something useful instead of watching sport show or visiting live matches. For example, 1 hour for your favourite hobby will be a great time spending because you do what you really like or you can do your unfinished work or begin to do it. There are a lot of thing you can do with this saved time and only you can decide to what you should use it.
On the other hand if you really like sport and your live connected with it somehow so why you should ignore shows or events associated with sport. You can visit football match with your friends and have a great time with soulmates who also likes sport also you can feel an incredible emotions. Watching it at home also allowed if you cant visit events personally so they are nothing can stop you from being with your favourite team or player.
By my own opinion I think that watching sports isnt a waste of time beacuse only you can manage your time and only you can choose what you like and want to watch and what not. There are also communication improvements when you share your emotions with other people who got so much feelings during match or fight.
In conclusion i should mark that there are many people with their points of view. Spend your time to sport if you like it and if you not use it for something other important instead of this kind of hobbies.
