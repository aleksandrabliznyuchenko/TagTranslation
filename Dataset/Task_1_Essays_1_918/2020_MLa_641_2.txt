Nowadays we are too wrapped up in our everyday activities and doing anything active sounds too hard for us. Still some people find some time to spend watching sports on TV or live. They consider to have a whale of a time doing so while others are opposed to this opinion claiming that it is not worth simply watching a sport you need to be involved. i tend to agree with the watching sports is a waste of time. First of my reason watching sports events on TV doesn't convey the whole atmosphere. It's still not the same emotions and eperiences. You can't communicate with fans in real time, offline. You can't exchange your opinion with them and shout support for the athlete. Moreover virtual sports can't replace real sports in any way.
Secondly, spending time watching TV sports programs is bad eyesight and overall health. A sedentary lifestyle negatively affects the work of the body, as soon as a person sits down, any electrical impulses immediately subside in his muscules.
In conclusion, i can say that real sports can not be replaced by a screen
