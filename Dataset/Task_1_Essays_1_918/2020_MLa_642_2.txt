According to some people, watching sports is a waste of time. I strongly disagree with this opinion as sports can be very informative. Watching sports are considered as a one of the most popular forms of relaxation suitable for all age groups of society. To begin with, watching sports can be educational and inspirational rather than just as they sad waste of time. Sports can motivate people to be healthy and strong, to love your county and a lot of things as friendship.
Another reason why watching sports is not waste of time is that it is the best form of being educated, because we can see sports in any languages we want. Hence, watching sports helps to us to be a part of our environment as it about health.
In conclusion, some people may vary in their views, but I think that i is a useful activity as it is provides education with entertainment.
