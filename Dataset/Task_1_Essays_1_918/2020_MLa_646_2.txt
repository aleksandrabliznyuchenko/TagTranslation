It is argued that watching sport activities no matter on TV-set or in stadium is a losing of time whit no profits. I completely disagree with this opinion an in this essay I will state reasons for my view.
The most compelling reason for holding to my view is that watching sports can be very usefull for sport teams or their treners to make a right strategy for the future games. First of all, team can notice weak and strong sights of another sport team, that they will play. All treners in trenning process shows to their students the examples of brilliant wins and fool mistakes in games of last plays.
Another reason for my position is that sport events and TV translations of them are important for people, who are interested in sport, because of inspiration that they gives. When person watch to good play of football players or athletic, he or she see an example of hardworking people, that do their job very well. It can motivate to start doing what person likes and to stop being sceared of bid changes in life. 190 Lastly, watching sports is not a waste of time, because some people prefer this spending of time to relax after a tough day or express their emotions, while the look play of their favorite team. There are two kinds of people. The first kind is person that is really tired and do not want think about anything. They just want to seat in a comfortable sofa and watch something positive. The second type is person that want to scream after a bed day to somebody for no reason. Sports on TV gives it.
In conclusion, I totally disagree with the opinion that watching sport activities or events on TV or offline is a waste of time. This is because it can be really helpful for sport teams to plan their actions and notice weak sights of anoter teams and for ordinary people to believe in themselfs and express their feelings.
