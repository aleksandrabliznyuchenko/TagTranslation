Nowadays, there is a position that watching sports at stadiums or on TV is usless activity. I wholeheartedly belive that this way to spend some time is not just a waste of it. I will support my point of view with arguments in the followind paragraphs.
First of all, watching sports can be a good reson to gather your friends together and not to be alone. In day and age we live, it can be difficalt to see with friends often. Our scuadeles are different and we have so many things to do excep meetings with someone. Watching some matches on TV can be a good reason to see each other. It is interesting to watch a sports event on TV togeter, because you can discuss the happening on the screen and share your oppinion with others. For instance, when the FIFA champion was held my friends and I often gathered together in our friend's flat to see matches, because each of us liked sports and did not want to be alone while whatched. It was funny and interesting, and gave us a lot of positive emothions.
Secondly, it can be a good abilyty to make new friends. Then you go to live sport events you meet a lot of people whith same interests, and you can easily start the conversation whithout any problems. The atmosfear on the stadium helps people to fill more confident and also helps to be more communicative. There are a lot of stories when persons met their good friends and even furure wifes and husbands at live sport event.
Taking everything into consederathion, I have no doubt that whatching sports is very usefull activite. It helps people to keep in touch and make new friends, moreover, it gives people positive emothions.
