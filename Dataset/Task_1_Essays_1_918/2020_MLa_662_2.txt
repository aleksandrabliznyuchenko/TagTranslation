There is a common opinion that sport programs are useless for people and don't worth to be watched both on TV and at live. I totally disagree with that. This essay will represent my own point of view on this statement.
First of all, sport is one of the most important part of people's lives. It helps us to be healthy and fit. Many people do sports and it is their main hobby. In this case, sportsmen can watch TV programs that based on sport activities to improve their theoretical skills. For example, beginner tennis player watches tournament on TV and observe different techniques by professional sportsman. In addition, artists can also watch different online videos to learn more about techniques of drawing. To my mind, this examples are similar.
Secondly, Live sports events are not just a show. Many people have their favorite team, for most of this people the team means more than a group of unknown people who do sports on the stadium. For instance, in England football lovers had their groups and after the games fans of different football clubs were punching each other in the face to prove that they are stronger. Moreover, basketball fans are perfect example too. Most people who comes to the live sports events are connected with the game They can be beginner players or professional trainers. This people are watching the game and motivating to continue theirs work to become a part of something more.
In conclusion, it would be necessary to mention that all people have their own opinion and every of them is valuable. To summarize, sports events are not always a waste of time, the most important thing is the goal of watching it either on TV or at live.
