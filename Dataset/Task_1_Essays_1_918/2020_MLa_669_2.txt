It is true that sports programmes and different matches have occupied a lot of broadcast time on TV. Nowadays sport is an important part of our life. But is watching sports events a productive way of spending time or is it a waste of time. Watching TV has had a great impact on people's entertainment since the envention of television. Different sports programmes are broadcasted in many different chanells almost 24 hours a day. Fistly, watching matches and programmes can have bad impact on your health. Sitting in front of the TV for hours with snacks and cola is not a good way to spend 3-4 hours. Secondly, sometimes these programmes are quite loud and cheering on the favourite team might bother people nearby. For example, father and son are watching rugby match with crisps and coke and cheering for the whole match, instead of that they could have played active games together and that would be, ore beneficial and useful. Finally, many people spend time in front of the TV watching sport instead doing something really profitable.

All those actions take almost the whole day. Futher more, there is always a risk of cancelling the match or game, probability of bad wheather conditions, unpleasant or rude people on the seat beside. These factors will make visit not just a waste of time, but a horrible waste of time. In conclusion, sports have a great influence on modern people's lifes, but not all ways of loving it are a good way to spend time. Spending hours watching others play is not an efficient and healthy hobby.
