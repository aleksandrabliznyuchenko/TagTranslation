It is believed that watching sports is a completely waste of time. Actually, I disagree with this point of view, because i consider that virtual practises as watching sport shows or events can affect on human beings positively: motivate them to do sports, help to relax and improve social skills.
Firstly, i think that in our digital world we can not reduce of any virtual practices. So, it leads to some health problems due to everyday computer routine. But watching sports events on TV can help people to overcome laziness and start to live more active and sporty live. If somebody switches to the sport channel, he will see great sportsmens with rhe superb body shape and real motivation in life. Also, sport shows can give advice how to start to do exercises or to start to do some sport. Person will compare it to his life experience and reformulate his life goals. For example, he will buy some sport equipment for home practices.
Moreover, watching sport shows or live sport events can be a good way to relax and get some positive emotions. After a hard and nervous day people can watch their favourite sport shows and make their emotional condition more stable. Sport events have another one useful outcome- it can build identification and help person to find friends. For instance, football fans are strongly identificate themselves with their favorite team and other fans of this team. Therefore, they meet in real life, become a friends and start to communicate with each other more.
In conclusion, i should say that watching sports events can be a great opportunity to people start doing any sport, relax, do not think about their jobs or problems and find new friends among other fans of different sport games.
