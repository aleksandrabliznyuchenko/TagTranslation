Watching sports is a great way to spend weekend. However, some people think that watching it is not as productive. Perhaps it is not entirely true. This essay will attempt to explain how efficient watching sports games is.
Today there are very few kinds of leisure activities that people really like and "watching sports" is one of them. The reason why people prefer watching sports rather than lack of time. As a result, they meet their needs for sport activities by watching games.
Highly entertaining as they are, people can sit for hours and watch sports competitions. In addition, they continue to consume unhealthy food and alcohol. Therefore, many people say that it is a waste of time. If instead people were doing sports themselves, it would be more useful for their physical condition.
In practice, however, not all people are physically engaged in sports. As a result, most of them prefer to watch them instead, whether it is a local game held at a nearby venue or on TV. However, it is only a waste of time if the complementary activities include include junk food and alcohol. In fact, watching games together with friends is a great way to have fun with friends and socialize. In conclusion, i do not agree that watching sports at leisure is a waste of time. It can be a waste of time if watch too much on TV. But then again, being a passive viewer on the ground or in the front of TV is not as bad as it is usually portrayed.
