Nowadays, there is an opinion that sport events are not important for spending time. It can be such TV sports as live sports events. To my mind, sports is one of the events, which important for watching in any form (online or offline).
Initially, sports event develop team spirit. If every person watch football match, hockey, skating or other kind of sports, it will be proud of country and also be part of world, which is interested in one common idea. For instance, two years ago (2018) in Russia it happend an important sport events which called The world Football. This competition was the most famous in every country in 2018. All people watched sports TV and even people, who has never been keen on football. But this idea joined all worls and everyone became part of a frear event. Moreover, watching sports helps to get rid of problems and stress. People which regularly are interested live sport match, get a lot of energyu ad food mood. For example, it can be sucg events like hockey, football match end etc.
On the contrary, sport events is no useful for spending free time, because it is only wase one. Watching sports TV or live sports events can not give experience or knowledge. For example, people watch how football player is running with ball in the field and trying to win. But people, looking at the sport events, does not niether energy nor satisfaction.
Taking everything into consideration, watching sports always have plus and minus and how proverb says- Taster differs. I strongly believe that almost people will consider watching Sports TV and live sports are very useful, interesing and great spending of time.
