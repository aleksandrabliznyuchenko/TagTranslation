It is a common point of view that spending time on watching sports events is useless. I completely disagree with this opinion and assume, that it is an unfair statement. This essay will provide arguments against this saying.
First and foremost, sports events (live or just recorded) bring people of different cultural backgrounds together, even though they may be the fans of competing sports reams. That is due to fact, that all the individuals share the same emotions of excitement at the same time, although, spectators may attend the sporting event or just watch the match on TV at home or in the bar, but they still feel the same aura of joy. For instance, the World football championship took place in Russia in 2018 and in it could be clearly seen in Moscow how Russians communicated and shared the moments of happiness with tourists without anger or jealousy.
Moreover, many sports fans consider sport as the most valuable thing in their life. They may collect a merchandize of their favourite team, continiously attend the championships, being ready to fly to another part of the world just to see their team playing; therefore, nobody can say that watching sports is a waste of time for them. To cite an example, football fans are usually very dedicated to their team and make performances (such as fireworks, for instance) when it wins or comes to their native city.
To sum up, watching sports is not a useless way of spending leasure time, but a means of uniting people and giving a meaning to their lives. I strongly opine that watching sports events cannot be thought of as an activity that has no sense.
