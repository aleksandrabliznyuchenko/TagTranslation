The first bar chart illustrates changes in the use of Facebook in March 2012 and 2013 and the second diagram shows males and females reasons for using Facebook. It is clearly seen that more users use desktops, than mobile phones. In 2013 the number of people who used desktops to connect Facebook slightly dropped, and the number of those who used mobiles became almost twice bigger than in 2012.
Talking about the main reasons for using Facebook, I can find some trends. It is shown that more women, than men are active Facebook users, and sharing photos and videos is the popular activity for them. Sharing photos and videos also is the main reason of using Facebook for men, who are also interested in receiving updates. Learning about ways to help others is the reason of using Facebook for the lowest percentage of both males an females users.
