It is argued that spectate sports online or watch live sports events is a waste of time. I strongly disagree with this point. In this essay I will support my view with relevant arguments of watching sports.
Firstly, watching sports is good for understanding rules of sports and extending knowledge about the world. There are more topics to discuss about with person that is watching any kind of sport activities, because they know something in this particular area and they can support the dialogue. For instance, if anyone knows something that I do not know, I will be glad to listen this person about it.
Secondly, watching sports makes people vigorous. That means for some people watching sports is more than just watching TV, that makes them happy. For example, it is generally-known that if a person watching sports hormones would produce in their body, such as serotonin that does people feel happy.
Finally, watching sports is tradition in some countries. Watching sports unites people across the country and they watch it with family, friends or with other fans. For instance, people in England watch football national premier league in bars with other friends or at home with family. It depends on each person because in England almost everyone has his or her tradition of watching football.
To sum it up, watching sports not only is good time spending but also sometimes can be helpful if a person is not in the mood, for instance. Therefore, watching sports helps with new knowledge about the world or in this case about sports. Also, it is a tradition for millions of people on Earth to spectate for their favorite sportsman or team.
