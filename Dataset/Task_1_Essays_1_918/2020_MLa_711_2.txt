Some people believe that spending your own time on watching sports programs or competitions is killing free time, which you can spend on some useful activities. However, personally I agree with this point of view, because watching sports TV can has many serious disadvantages.
First of all, you can spend time with dear friend and support our favourite sport team together. Cheering together brings us closer, so it is a great opportunity to get together and have fun. Moreover, viewing football, basketball or another sport competition can increase your expertise in such kind of sport activity. It teach to understand the players strategy, how to cooperate in team and other tricks. That is why watching sports offers a lot of advantages and useful in everyday life. On the other hand, watching sport programs has many disadvantages too. it makes people lazier. Some of people spend hours watching sport competition. Even if they can go to the stadium and support favourite team, they are stay at home and leaf through sports channels. Moreover, spending so much time in front of TV is very dangerous for health. People can spoil vision and gain extra weight. Usually people eat junk food, when they watch sport. So, there is a huge risk to become overweight. That is why people do not need to spend their free time on it.
In conclusion, watching sports programs has its proc and cons, but as for me such hobby is a waste of time. People demand their health, while can do some more useful activities.
