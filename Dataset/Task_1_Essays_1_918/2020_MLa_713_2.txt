According to the people, spending time by watching some sports events is just killing your free time. However, I disagree with this statement, because to my mind this activity has a lot of benefits.
To begin with, people who dont watch the sports, dont understand why they another people do it. They cannot do it in their free time, because they state that it just a waste of time. From their point of view, that its better to go and start training. This time which another people waste on watching TV, they can do a lot of profits for themselves. For example, they can spent time with family, do trainings, cook a delicious dinner or read a book, to develop themselves.
On the other point, people, who love watching TV with theirs favourites sport events. They just fans of somebody famous sport man or they love some football band, so they are interested of their future in sport world, so they are experiencing. How they can not to watch this sports?! It just hobby, for them it isnt a waste of time. Its their life. To sum up, i can understand these two position: people, who dont watch TV sports and another people who see in this action their own life. Unfortunately, in my mind people must watch sports events on TV and another gadgets. Its perfect when people are interested in something, they have aims in this actions.
