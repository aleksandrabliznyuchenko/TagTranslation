There is a statement that watching sport TV shows is a non-productive and irrational way to spend your free time. It can be said, what i agree with this statement and let me explain my opinion.
First of all, sport games are one of the most exciting and fascinating events, especially if it is World Champions. Millions of sport fans around the planet ready to go in other countries to visit it no matter how much it cost or how far it is because people want to feel real emotions during the games. To illustrate, the world football championship 2018 in Russia bring together in one place different cultures and it was amazing loud event lasted next few months. Unfortunately, people who cannot be involved in this process watch translations from their homes and, i consider, it is not the same because when you seat in front of the screen you cannot feel the same atmosphere.
Secondly, often adults watch sport games in pubs and sport bar where they drink alchogol. Moreover, the large amount of male audience behave agressively and sometimes do not understand how they should act in a public place. For example, last year one man in a sport bar located in Saint-Petersburg while watching the hockey match argued with other fan and punch him in the face because he was drunk.
To sum it up, sport games are better to be watched alive in a stadium because it can give people a lot of brilliant feelings and an opportunity to make new friends and other social meaningful connections. At the same time sports on TV frequently used to show in public places such as bars or pubs so people can be dangerous for others if they "true" fan and when they want to show proofs of greatness of favorite team it might be possible to lead serious injures and incidents.
