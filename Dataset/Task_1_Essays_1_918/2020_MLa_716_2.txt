There is a widely spread opinion that watching sports on TV or at live sports events is a useless time spending. However, there are plenty of people whose viewpoint differs. Further I would like to discuss both positions and express my own opinion.
To begin with I would like to note, that every type of sport might be extremely aggressive and in some cases even harmful for players. For instance, if you are an elderly man watching a soccer player score a goal, your blood pressure might consequently rise, which is very unhealthy in such an age condition. Secondly, it is well-known truth that the most popular activity while observing sports is consuming junk food. Various types of burgers, french fries and beverages with high amounts of sugar are also not beneficial for inner health. In addition to that, it is definitely better to experience a real game on your own. Rather than watching a swimming competition on your couch, it is always preferable to take your swimsuit and visit a pool.
On the other hand, if we take a look from a parent's perspective, watching sports offline or online can develop child's attention skills or educate them on something new. For example, chess championships are a great way to teach a youngster some strategy and tactics competency.
Personally, i believe that everything should be balanced. Time management is very significant, when it comes not only to watching sports, but also a lot of other life aspects. If you enjoy observing sport events - you should defineitely do it. However, it is still important not to go too far. All the things should be in moderation.
