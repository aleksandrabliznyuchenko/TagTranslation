There is an opinion that watching sport events on TV or live is a waste of time. I totally disagree with this idea because I believe that this kind of entertainment can positively affect on people.
Firstly, it helps people to get along with each other. In many countries watching sports together is a ritual. People watch football matches together on TV or go on a baseball tournirs. Emotions that men and women feel when their favorite player gets a score are very postive and it makes them feel like they're friends or even relatives. As a result, strangers oftenly hug each other when their favorite team wins the game or cry together when they lose. Moreover, ther is an amount of Hollywood movies where father brings his son to baseball or basketball game to became closer to him. One of these movies is "Pursuit of Happyness", starring Will Smith and Jaden Smith.
Secondly, watching sports brings adrenaline. Emotions that sport events bring to it's fans are very strong. We can't imagine a good sport game without screaming people on the stadium or court. Actually, it was scientifically provided that watching sports either on TV or at live sports events makes your body generate adrenaline. This process makes human less stressed and helps him to feel menatlly better.
To conclude, I don't agree with the opinion that watching sports is a waste of time. I believe that sport entertainment can be not only funny but also help our minds and bodies. As I pointed, this activity can prodive postive consequences like getting closer to someone or starting to feel less stressed.
