The folowing graph represents the information about the dynamic of using Facebook over the years 2012-2013 and the most significant reasons for men and women to use it. Overall, it is clear that Facebook mobile version became much more popular in 2013 and most people of both genders use this social app to share photos and videos.
The number of people that use the desktop version of Facebook slightly decreased - from about 150 mln followers to nearly 135 mln. On the other hand, mobile version became more widespread: there was a sudden rise in 2012 and the number of followers riched the number of more than 95 mln (about 40% more than the previous year).
As can be seen from the graph, the most common reason for people to use Facebook was to share photos and videos (more than half of men-respondents and nearly 40% of women). However, women found this reason as equally important as the second - receiving updates (the reason was also chosen by 39% of women). Another quite popular variant was seeing funny posts. The least important reason for people to use Facebook was learning about ways to help others - only a quater of women chose it and about a third part of men.
