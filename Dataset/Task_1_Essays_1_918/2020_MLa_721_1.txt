Bar charts describe how people of both sexes used Facebook in period from 2012 and 2013 and main aims for this.
Overall, as can be clearly seen from the charts, the number of those, who visited this social net from desctop is more than two times bigger than the proportion of those, who used Facebook from personal mobile phones, in march 2012. In addition, the mostly shared reason for using the Facebook among women was ''sharing photos/videous'' and made up more then the half of the answers (54%). In the same time, men stated that used this social net in same way for receiving updates and sharing photos.
In march 2013, there was a significant difference between those who used the Facebook from the desctop and those who prefered mobile phones for this (almost 140 and 100 millions of users, respectively). It is clear that the ''learning about ways to help people'' was the most unpopular reason for using Facebook.
