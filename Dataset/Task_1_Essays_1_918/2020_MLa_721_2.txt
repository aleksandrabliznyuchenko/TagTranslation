Nowadays, it is argued by some that watching sport events is really unworthy activity. I totally disagree with this point of view and in this essay will state the reasons for my opinion.
One of the most compelling arguments for watching sports (both on TV and in real time) is that it is kind of a high-quality leisure time. This is because during such activity humans body feels adrenaline. For instance, while watching football match, the person desires one team to win and expresses his or her emotions of excitement. As a result, the hormone of happiness is produced and a person gets great mood.
In addition, sport events is usually a great opportunity to spend time with the closest people who share your interests. For example, when national competitions are held, the feel of unity can bring families together and make them spend at least few hours gathered at home. This will result in warm relationship between relatives.
Lastly, watching sports can be a start point of beginning own sport activities. Some watchers get so fascinated by certain kind of sport that really will to try it themselves. For example, there are those, who made up the decision of entering big tennis section after years of watching it on TV propram. Consequently, their inspiration becomes that rapid point in life and changes it completely.
In conclusion, I do not agree that watching sports is a useless entertainment. It is actually a beneficial way to spend free time becuase of its emotional and inspiring role.
