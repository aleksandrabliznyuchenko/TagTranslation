Nowadays, some people think that watching sports games at real sports events or on televison is waste of time. Other group of people think that it is not. This essay will discuss both views about this topic and provide my agreement.
On the one hand, people think that watching sports is a waste of time. Firstly, you can spend your free time on other important things like studying or spending time with your friends or family instead of watching sports on TV or do the same thing in real life. Secondly, you can do sports by yourself and be healthy instead of watching someone doing the same thing that you can do by yourself. In addition to this, sports games industry has rates where a lot of people lost their money if they are not so lucky.
On the other hand, watching sports could be very interesting and makes you feel very emotional, especially when you have a favoirite team or a player. I suppose, that it is like watching a movie but in real life. Sometimes you can't predict what is going to be next in sports games. Moreover, if you have a favoirite team then you can find new friends who love the same team as you. Sports games unite people and makes them feel like this place is their second home.
To conclude, i agree that watching sports in real life or on television is a waste of time because people could find a lot of different other things which could make them feel happy or amuzed. Moreover, i think that while you watching sports you can't be more educated and find new knowledge because it is just an entertaiment.
