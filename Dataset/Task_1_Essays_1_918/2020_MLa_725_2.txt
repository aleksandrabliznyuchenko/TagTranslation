It is belived among some individuals that there are no benifits in watching sport events. I must disagree, in my opinion this statement is incorrect and I am goining to prove my point in the following essay.
Initially, i reckon that sport in itself is an extreamly uniting force. There are many people that share love and adoration to different kinds of activities. However sports events influence all the nations. For instance, I remember the football games that were hapenning all around Russia and I remanisce how people shouted in awe and happines from all the building around me. Even though, I am not a fan of sports I immensly enjoyed that feeling of mutual recognition and respect towards our players and it is fun to share such joy with others.
Moreover, it is worth mantioning that watching sport can bring some kind of feeling of clousure to the people who are unable to play for whatever reason. It is almost impossible to not be investsed in the process of a game. You are cheering for the players to win and outsmurt their foes. Furthermore, I heared about a reasearch that proves existence of a connection between people who do not usually play active sports games themselves and their perception of live sport games. Attendies feel as much satisfaction from observing others play as they would feel if they would be the one on the feeld. One reason for it is because as active particapants these people see flawes in their strategies and behaviors. However, as only a part of the audience they have no need to feel self-constious.
To sum up, I would like to say that watching sports games is good for you if you like it. May be it is not essential for our lives but definetly not something that should be considered a waste of time. Most importatly, you are in charge of how to spend your time.
