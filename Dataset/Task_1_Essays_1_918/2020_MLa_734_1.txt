I want to compare these two charts. If we look at the first chart that shows which platform people use. We can see that in March 2012 more people used Facebook by their desktops than in March 2013 for about 50 points. It happens because phone industry start taking its place on the top. Lets see at the other chart which shows how many people use their phones to join Facebook, we can see a really big progress. it raised for about twice. Its a really good result and this explains why people use their desktops less.
Talking about second chart which shows what woman and man likes more on Facebook, we can see that woman share thair photos and videos much more than man. What is more, they like funny posts more too. However, man and woman are using Facebook to receive updates the same. Moreover, woman use Facebook more than man to learn about ways to help other people.
