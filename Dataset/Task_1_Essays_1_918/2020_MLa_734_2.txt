Nowadays, a lot people are into watching sports, but there are a lot of people who think that watching sports is just waste of time. So, is watching sports waste of time or it a good way to relax and spend your free time. On the one hand, people watch sports because it is interesting. Often people who love watch sports are sportsman and this is their life. They are really into it and it is hard to find something more interesting then their lovely hobby or even job. For some fans it is just a good way to spend free time and for other ones it is something more, all of as know about football fans around the whole world. People finding their lovely team, if it is football or basketball, or lovely player, for example tennis player, and when they watch them on tv they can relax for couple of hours and forget about their problems. Moreover, watching sports it is a good way for people who can not do it because of their health to be "on the same plate" with other people. What is more it helps them to feel themselves mode self-confident and happy.
On the other hand, other people are sure than watching sports it is just waste of time and if you really love sport and you want to be port of it, you should do something, doing any kind of sport instead of being a "coach potato" on the sofa watching TV. Moreover, people think that watching sports it is silly and it is better to read a book or watch a great movie to spend your free time. I, personally, think that watching sports sometimes is a good way to spend your free time or hang out with your friends.
Finally, i want to be sure that people who are into watching sport and people who hates it will stop arguing and will peacefully live together.
