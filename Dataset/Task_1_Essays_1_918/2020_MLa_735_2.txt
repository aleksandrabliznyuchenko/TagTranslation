Many people believe there is absolutely no reason for watching sports using different channels of communication. Others are sure it could be useful in any ways. I personaly tend towards the opinion that watching sport events can help people to advance their personal spirit.
Speakig about that type of person who considers that watching sports competitions is time-waisting, there is a following argument. Laying on a sofa or sitting on a tribune sport fanats do not receive any motivation to do sport activities themselves. By the way of example, football fanats at a football match just skream, eat chips and drink pounds of beer. Such lifesile is definitely unhealthy and can lead such harmful effects as obesity, for instance.
On the other hand, it is known that watchng TV programmes about sports as well as live events could give fans an incredible motivation to get into their best shape and do their best in any sport sphere. Much have been done in recert years to make peoples' health better, for instance, social advertisements have appeared on television and sports events as a factor of motivating people takes their place.
As for me, I tend toward the second opinion and consider that watching professional sportsmen could be extremely inspiring. In other words it is a chance to test your limits, while others do not even keep in mind the problem of bad health. Inspiring by dangerous types of sport people have a great opportunity to step outside their save zone and become a part of a big sport community.
In conclusion, it is significant to mention that I consider watchng sports can have a large positive impact on peoples' motivation to get into their greater shape. On the other hand, everyone should feel themselves free to choose the right way of fitnessing.
