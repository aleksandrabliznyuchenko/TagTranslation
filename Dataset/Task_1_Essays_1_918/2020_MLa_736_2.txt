Some people believe that watching sports game on TV or live has no advantage at all. This essay will support the different view about this topic.
In my opinion, watching sport games is not a waste of time because it wiil help to avoid stressful situations and depression. Firstly, a lot of people sometimes have such days when everyone needs to relax to solve problems with mental health. Every person do it in his or her own way. For some people it is nessecery to shout and crash everything, so, watching sports game such as football as the most popular one is the right decision. People can do such 'therapy' without harming mentaly their family members or friends. For example, my father is fonds of watching football games and he does it almost every day after doing his job, he says that it heps him to have a positive emotions after hard work. Secondly, for many people it is the good way to find new friends with the same interests. A lot of teenagers face with such problem as loneliness because in this period of age most of them are shy and don't like their personality. To tell the truth, some of them stay lonely even when they become older. So, when people watch live sport games and visit these events they also can find a lot of interesting people to become friends with. For instance, when it was a big annual football event in Russia almost in every street and pub after the game people become closer to each other and communicate with everyone like they know each other for ages.
In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the statement that watching sport games is just a waste of time because it can help people to avoid stress and depression and some of them can find new friends with the same interests.
