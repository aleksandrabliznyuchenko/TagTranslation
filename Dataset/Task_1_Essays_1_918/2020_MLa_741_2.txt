There has been a controversial topic of whether watching any sporting events is a waste of time or not. Some people say, that this can leed to wasteful time management, when someone can do more useful tasks, while others state that it is a very fun and social time spending. I do agree with the point of people who think that watching sports is an interesting and eventful activity and can be balanced to not affect your main productivity.
The main disadvantage of this is the waste of people's limited time, because their busy life cannot add long-lasting sporting games to the schedule. This is considered as the main disadvantage of this acitivity. The more you watch these games, the more you find yourself involved with them, and the time flies very fast. In the end, you find out that you have very little amount of time left on your more productive things such as work, hobbies and even family. For example, you can watch football games of your favourite teams on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and the whole weekend - each game lasting 90 minutes. That counts for almost 7 hours of watching TV on the sofa. That is why people might think it is the ultimate waste of time. However, there is also an advantage to this which is just having fun and socialize with your best friends or family. Sports can unite people because of watching the same game or cheering for your favourite club or sportsman. You may have drinks, eat tasty food and feel the adrenaline - these are the high-dopamine things our brain likes so much. Moreover, you may find new friends, learn something new and expand your analytical skills. That is why so many people love watching sports and do it every week throughout the year.
With both views discussed there is a clear evidence of both advantages and disadvantages to this topic. Sometimes it is considered a waste of time, and sometimes it is just an original way to spend your days off.
