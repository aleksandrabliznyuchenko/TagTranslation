Many people believe that going to sports events or watch them in TV is not useful time spending. As for me, I disagree with this point of view. I'd like to explain my opinion.
Firstly, watching spots is something that unites people. When people support and watch games of some team, they feel that they are part of something bigger than themselves. They unite and fight with supporters of other teams. People feel adrenalin while the team which they support win or lose. When the game takes place people feel emotions which can not be described. This feelings can full you for a long period of boring work. Moreover, families go to sport events or watch them on TV and this is the only thing that they do together. Fathers take their children with them to support team which they support for many years and it becomes family tradition.
Secondly, watching on TV or going to live sports events can help you to do sport by yourself. Sportsmen can inspire other people to go to some sport club. Children want to be like sportsmen, they always have posters or something like that and it helps them to do sport, to be healthy and fit. Also, when the team which people support lose they think that they can do better. This inspire people to play sport games by themselves and be more healthy.
In conclusion, I think that spots events are really helpful for some people. They provide happy and inspiring mood. They unite unknown people, family together and several families.
