Nowadays, people have a lot of abilities how to spend their leisure time. Some of them prefer watching sport programs or going to some sport games to watch it alive. I believe that this is a usefull activity that helps people to relax, spend time with their friends and to enjoy the game.
Firstly, sport is a key secret of a good health and especially mental health. Of course, it is better to do sport than to watch it, sitting in front of a TV. Anyway, watching sport is a really pleasant passtime. All people should relax and forget about home or work problems. I consider that watching sport can help people metally and can make them forget about problems for some time. For example, when someone needs an emotional relief, we used to go outside for some activities, to breath fresh air and to meet close people. Visiting of live sports events is a good idea to relieve emotional sterss.
Secondly, as I notices before, attending sport events can bring friends or family members together. People need to spend time with others because we need sociaty. To my mind watching sports, either on TV or at live sports events, has only benefits. It is important to notice that this sort of activity is very popular today. People started to work harder and spend more time on their jobs. On the other hand, they understand that they should pay attention to their families and friends. The best way to bring with family and friends together is to go on a live sport game or gather together in front of a TV.
In this way, sport is a very important part of our life and no matter how you are going to interact with it. Only by watching sport you can improve your mental health, maintain good relations with friends and make closer with your family.
