The fist diagram illustrates the reason why men and women chose to use Facebook between 2012 and 2013 via the laptop or mobile phone. Overall, using the desktop was the main variant for both men and women (135 and 150 respectively) in these two years. In contrast, approximately a quarter of males put their choice for using social network on their smartphones, which was twice as high as the females response (95 and 55).
The second diagram shows the reason why men and women are into using Facebook in 2012 and 2013. The vast majority of females prefer spending their free time on social networks is for sharing photos and videos (54%) contrasting with the minority of males (39%) doing similar thing. This pattern is reversed when examining under the learning about the ways to help others category with almost three quarters of females spending this amount compared only to 25% of males. The receiving updates category shows fewer marked differences.
To sum up, it can be seen that men and women do not always give the same reasons for spending quality time on Facebook and, in general, women prefer more to share memories with Facebook friends.
