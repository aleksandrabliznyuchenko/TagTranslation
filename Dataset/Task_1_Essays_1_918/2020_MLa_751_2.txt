In our modern life some people consider that to watch sports events and programs is wasting time, while other believe that it is the good entertainment. I strongly believe that there are many other ways to spend time and claim that watching spots is useless.
Nowadays sport has a great impact on people. First of all, people on sports events are ussually impolite. For example, they drink beer unstoppable and sae swearing words in order to cheer their favorite team. Thus, this impolite behavior influences children in negative way.
Secondly, it will be more beneficial for person to read a book or to spend leisure time with family. In other words, watching sports does not give the person useful skills. For iistance, theperson can join a reading club in order to broaden their horizons. In addition, they can play some sports instead of watching. The reason is than the person will be fitter and healthier.
To sum up, I want to say that watching sport events is not the best way to spend our free time and people should understand, that we must develop our kowledge, fit, healt instead of waste time.
