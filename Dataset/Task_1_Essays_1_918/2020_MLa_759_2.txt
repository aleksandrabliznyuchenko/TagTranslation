Some people believe that watching sport is a unuseless spend time while others consider that it is very useful. I agree that watching sport is a waste of time. And in this essay I want to prove my position.
Firstly, I consider that doing sport is better then watching it. When people only watch sport they start to become lazy and fat. They start to think that watching sport can make them professional in some kind of sport. They watch it and only cry if reals sportsmen make mistakes. I think, that football in Russia is a good example of it. In our country we have millions people who are sure that they are masters of football. But, unfortunately, these masters only sit on their sofas and say bad words about our team. They even do not think that such behavior does nobody help. So these people only become more fat and unhealthy.
And secondly, I am sure that situation when many people watch sport is a way for making sport only a business. When many people do sport we can have healthy nation and high concurention for titul of good sportsman. However, when we have more people only watching sport and little people do it we lose sport as a thing for be health. We start to create a sport as a show. Sportsmen start think about money and pr, but forgot about sport and tournaments. And competions begin to become a place for show and money, but they must be a place for becoming better and stronger.
To sum up, I want to say, that wile some people consider that watching sport is a good thing for them, I am sure that watching sport is a waste of time. I think that do sport is better then watch it.
