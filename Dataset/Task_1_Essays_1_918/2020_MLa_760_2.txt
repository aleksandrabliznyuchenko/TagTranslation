There is a popular belief that watching sports simply wastes people's time. I totally agree with this statement and share the opinion that either TV or live sports events are useless for us. In the essay below i will provide some arguments for my point of view.
Firstly, due to the developement of technologies, we can watch sports on TV every day and it creates an illusion that we are actually doing some sport activities too, even if in reality we keep staying in our appartments all day long. Obviosly, we could've spent our time more rationally and do some really important things for our life. For example, my friend Max is a big fan of football matches and he keep watching them all the time, instead of actually going to the sport center and trying to play football by himself.
Moreover, watching sports, no matter how - online or in real live, is really stressfull for a lot of people. Very often, we have our favourite sportsmen who we want to see on the piedistal. Unfortunately, they can not win every competition plus sometimes they have helth problems. Fans start to worry for them, sometimes too much that it is not good for their own helth. For example, my girlfriend is a big fan of Evgeniya Medvedeva, famous figure scater. When Evgeniya couldn't win the Olympic Games my girlfriend got seek because she was very nervous watching the competition.
In conclusion, i would like to say that despite some pleasant things about watching sports, it is mostly waste of time that is not healthy for us. It is much better to do some real activities, such as sports, reading books etc
