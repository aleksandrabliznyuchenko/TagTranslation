Paccive participacion in sport activities has become a traditional hobby. Gathering family members or friends at one place to watch the game of football or worring about which athlete will get to the finish line first can be joyfull. However, not everyone can agry that it is a usefull activity that realy benefits ones mind. I firmly disagree with the opinion that watching sports is a boring or unreasonable hobby.
Firt of all, for some individuals especially young ones sport shows can become a motivation for participation into activities. The idea of teamplay which is often marked by casters or athletes working hard to achieve their goals is a viable lesson for children, that results and fame are achivable with the help of everyday exercises and personal discipline, that a teamplayer is a person that gives more than gains.
Secondly, watching sports is a topic for a friendly talk. In many situations in life an individual would need a way of approaching a conversation with a new person, and the knowledge for example of futball teams and their up to date ranks will benefit the small talk marginally. It is arguable that the people might not be as fans of sport as an individual but it will still be a topic for discussion.
However, live sport broadcasts are used by marketing companies for advertising and the structure of such shows is made to be simple and addictive, which does not bring benefit to watchers. The idea of bubblegum content is a way to make money for product companies but not to create ideas in minds of consumers.
To sum up, i would like to state that a hobby of watching sports can be a wholesome expirience full of new discoveries of topics for small talks or motivational lessons for life, despite its consumerist nature.
