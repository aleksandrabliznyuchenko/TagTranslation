Sport competitions is one of the most popular ways to spend your free time with family or friends. People all over the world prefer to meet together, buy some snacks and relax while watching some sport event. Nevertheless, there are people thinking that this action is just a waste of time that you could spend on much more important tasks.
In my opinion, watching sport competitions is not a waste of time. Firstly, by watching event, groups of friends have one more reason to meet together. When it is a rainy day, nobody wants to walk at the park or go somewhere else. But of your group who has a TV can invite others home for watching sport competition. Moreover, if all of you like the same team that others do, it is even more interesting to vote for it together. Secondly, sport events are also helpful for people doing sport by themselves. For example, if some student plays football on weekends with his friend, he can find some useful movements, tricks and decisions that professional player does on match and try to use it in his own game.
Nevertheless, some people tell that concentration on TV screen while sport event has bad influence on people's health. When eyes and brain are so concentrated on a game, your sight may become worse and other organs suffer too.
I cannot agree with this point of view. A lot of British articles shows that watching sport competitions helps your brain to remember information about several actions at the same time. When you watch football match, you need to keep an eye at 22 players at the same time not to miss something important, and this type of activity is very important for our minds.
To sum up, sport events are not only interesting and useful for friends to spend time together. It is also helpful for our body to remember some moves in sport and brain to train our concentration. A lot of people watch this type of events every week, and there is no reason to blame them for this action, because it is not just a waste of time.
