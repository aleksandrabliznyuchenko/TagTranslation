Sport is an essential part of people's lives. Doing sports brings you energy, it builds your whole body and makes your immune system stronger. However, some people prefer watching sports to doing it. People who love gathering in bars and discussing sports events can not be judged by me. Nevertheless, I strongly agree with the point that watching sports is a waste of time. Firstly, let me consider the reasons why watching sports can be useless. To begin with, watching sports does not give a person anything but obesity (caused by sitting on a sofa and drinking beer, which is considered to be a tradition while watching sports) and bad health in general. It is much better to do sports than just watching it. Moreover, watching sports relaxes a human's body in a bad way. It is literally turns off a person's brain. It is much better to relax by reading a book or even by watching a documentary.
Furthermore, watching sports support the idea of inequality and injustice in the job industry. People like doctors and firemen get less money than football players, which is completely wrong. Sportsmen do not save lives but they earn an enormous amount of money every month, which is unfair. What is more, watching sports may encourage children to quit their school and drop the studies in order to become a famous sportsman, which can be a false desire. I believe that children should do sports without sacrificing their real future.
In conclusion, I would like to mention that doing sports is a better way of spending time than just watching it. Watching sports in not a healthy pastime.
