Many people believe that one kind of wasting time is to watch sport. I strongly disagree with this statement. From my point of view watching spots gives birth to a love of sport appeal of life and enhance bonding within communities.
Watching sport games is a great opportunity for all kinds of people to make friends, come together and cheer for their favourite sport gamer or a team. All people on the tribune have different lifes, jobs, families, religious beliefs and financial position. When they watch the game, they have only one concern and that is there team playing with rivals. Watching sports help people to love the life and forget their differences and bring people closer.
Finding friends is not the only benefit of sport games. Watching sports can promote a healthier lifestyle among people. Watching sports make feel encouraged to be same, be sporty, healthy, fit and live without pernicious habits. They become sportier.
To conclude, watching sports is not a waste of time. It help people to become closer, healthier and sportier. Watching sports leaves only positive effect on the lifes of individuals.
