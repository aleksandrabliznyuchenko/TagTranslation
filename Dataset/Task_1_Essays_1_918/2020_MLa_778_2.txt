It is thought by some people that watching sports (both alive and online) is a good leisure activity. However, others suppose that there is no benefit in watching sport games. As for me, I stick to the point that watching sports programmes or game observing are pretty useless.
Firstly, the observation of the players creates a simulation of participation. It is worth noting that this activity captures the attention of the person, but does not develop their abilities.
