Some people believe that it is such a wasting time to watch sport on TV or attend sport events. I totally disagree with this opoenion. From my point of view, watching sport can promote healthy lifestyle among people and enhace the power of ties within communities.
Watching sport on television or from the stadion or the bar is an opportunity for people to get together and cheer for thier favourite team. Fans have theit own languge, identity clothes and a status in life despite their religious belifs or political preferences. However, they have common discurse because while they watch the game, only they need is emerge victorious. So that, people are motivated in getting closer and forgetting about their differences during sport events.
Community bonding is not the only one benifit of spending time by watching sport. People feel encouraged to keep fit and have healthy habbits while they look at their favourite sportsmen. The most popular sportpersons have a kind of authority for teenagers as a super peer. Obviously, people who watch sports matches regularly tend to live physically active lives.
To sum up, whatching sports is not a waste of time. It promotes strongly community's bonding and has positive effect on people lifestyle by encouraging them to be more healthy and active.
