There are a lot of people who beliave that watching sports is a wasting time. But also there is an opinion that this is very important. I disagree with this statement, in my opinion, it is really good and watching sports is absolutely not wasting time. First of all, watching sports can motivate people to do something. There are a lot of cases in history when people started to do sport after watching sports games or sports competitions. Secondly, it is a good way for relaxing. After job lots of people really like to relax, i think it is better to spend their time this way, than they, for example, will drink beer or smoke sigaretes.
On the other side we have an opinion that watching sports is wastig time. This people think that humanity should not relax, in theirs minds it is absolutely the same things They think that every person should work everyday starting in the morning and ending at night. But there is a problem, if people is not relaxing they would not to do anything. Maybe they will do something, but it wiil be not well at all, because they are tired, of course people work harder and better when they have power and strong, and after watching sports people have it.
To sum up my reasoning, i would like to say that watching sports it is an important part of life many of people and nobody should not to say that is kind of entertainment is wasting time, because watching sports can be more than relax it can be hobby, or for example job.
