There is an opinion that people who watch sports on TV programm or visite a live sports events waste their time. I disagree with this point of view. As for me, I think that this is the great activity for everybody for some reasons, thats I show below.
First of all, observing sports is a perfect type of relax after hard day. You can have in interaction and be happy or sad about your favorite team, who wins or loses. Watching sports helps you to give a freedom of yours emotions.
Secondly, then you visite a live sports events you support your favorite team and give them more chances to bring victory. Sitting on the tribune and criing the gymn of their teams, encourages sportsmens and give them a hope.
Thirdly, culture of fans is one the most essential culture in the world. Many people participate in this culture. Beeing a fan is the great possibility to find a new friends or even a futer wife or husbend. Sports culture reunion fans all over the world.
And the last reason why watching sports is a good way to spend your time is that people who watch sports are healthier than people who dont watch sport, because this is a good way to motivate yourself for doing some activites.
