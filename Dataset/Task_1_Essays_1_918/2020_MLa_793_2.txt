Nowadays, television have become a huge part of our lives. More and more people organising home parties or special events, where they stay together and watching sport matches. Some people argue that it is irrelevant use of time, whereas others believe, it can prove beneficial. To my mind, watching sports has more drawbacks then advantages.
First of all, watchig sports discourage people to take part in some activities by their own. Thus, people have become more close and unsociable. Especially, it is really important for young generation, because they need to learn how to integrate into a socium.
Secondly, it can lead to mental health problems. Doing sports can help a peson to feel refresh after a long and difficult day. Some acivities are very significant for human beings. It is a great opportunity to express all negative emotions. What is more, watching spots rather than particinating on it can be harmful for physical condition too. For examle, when a student come home, he or she starts to lay on a bed insead of going to the gym or play tennis. To add a point, it can be damaging for eyes, because people spend too much time nearby TV.
To sum up, in my oponion, watching sports is one of the most irrtional way to spend time. People shoud avid it and do anything else.
