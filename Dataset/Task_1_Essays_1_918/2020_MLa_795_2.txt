In our modern world there are lots of different ways for entertaining people. Such things can be swimming, playing videogames, watching films and etc. One of these activities is watching sports. It is argued between people, is watching it could really entertain people or if it is just a waste of time. In my opinion, watching sports is an uninteresting way to spend one's time. Watching sports, obviously could not be compared to the real participation in it. As the result, you can't feel the real drill of the action, as you are a simple observer with no ability to change the outcome of the match. Also a negative part of people watching sport are betting companies, which turn out to be a mere money-makers with no idea of morality, that would suck the last cent of one's wallet for their own sake. Such companies should not be tolerated, but they won't disappear unless people continue watch sports.
On the other hand, people that love watching sports are easy to understand, First of all, fans of football/basketball/etc teams are a part of a great community. The fact that they belong to this enormous amount of people with shared interest could help them to create new connections between each other, so people with a few friends could socialize. Also, watching sports could bring some people new overwhelming emotions that could make their life more tasty.
Concluding all previously said there should be one thing mentioned: every person has its own will and right to choose which way of entertaining is the most suitable. However, some negative aspects of watching sports may affect unprepared people, so I agree that watching sports is a waste of time.
