There is a belief that watching different sports is a waste of time and I am totally agree with that opinion.
I consider that spending time on watching sport games is unproductive due to several reasons. First of all, if you like sport games you schould go out with your frends and play footbal or valleybal or anything you like. For exsample, I never watch sports on TV but play valleybal with my friends and classmates. If you do not have enough friends or if they are too busy you can go to some club where you will be able to play in teams with people like you. Only such envolvement will provide you with unforgettable emotions and experience. Secondly, instead of sitting in front of your TV for several hours you can read some interesting and usefull book which will help you to prepare for exams if you are a student or recive a promotion if you already have a job.
What is more, nowadays cyber sport became very popular. There are a lot of international competitions over popular games. That may seem that there is no difference in watching and playing them, but it is not true. While playing you have to think over your own strategy and be focused on game during the whole match. So, even playing computer games can have a positive effect while watching somebody's else game is useless and it is a waste of your time. In conclusion, watching any type of sport is useles waste of time. It is better to try playing sport games by your own because it wil give you more emotions and experience.
