NOWADAYS SPORT PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN OUR LIFE. MANY PEOPLE CLAIM THAT WATCHING DIFFERENT SPORTS EVENTS IS USELESS. AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED, WATCHING SPORTS PROGRAMMES DEFINITELY IS A WASTE OF TIME.
FIRST OF ALL, I THINK THAT IT IS BETTER TO DO SPORT IN REAL LIFE THAN TO OBSERVE IT. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BECOMES LOWER BECAUSE OF OUR TV. YOU ONLY WATCH A GAME AND SIT BEHIND THE DEVICE. IN ADDITION, MANY PEOPLE CAN EAT JUNK FOOD OR DRINK BEER WHILE THEY ARE WATCHING SOMETHING (INCLUDING SPORTS GAMES, OF COURSE). I BECOME VERY UPSET WHEN I SEE MY FATHER WATCHING FOOTBALL MATCHES AND EATING HAMBURGERS. SCIENTISTS PROVED MANY YEARS AGO THAT THIS WAY OF RELAXING IS VERY BAD FOR THE HEALTH.
THE SECOND THING IS THAT WATCHING SPORTS EVENTS IN THE STADIUM CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY STRANGE PEOPLE AMONG FOOTBALL FANS, FOR EXAMPLE. WE OFTEN SEE IN NEWS THAT MANY FIGHTS HAVE HAPPENED AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SUFFERED FROM FOOTBALL FANS.
THERE IS AN OPINION THAT SPORTS EVENTS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT AND COOL. I STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THEM. ALL I KNOW IS THERE ARE MANY THINGS TO DO INSTEAD OF SPENDING TIME LIKE THIS. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN DO SPORT IN REAL LIFE, OR READ AN INTERESTING BOOK. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE TO GO OUT WITH FRIENDS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE ACTIVE.
TO SUM UP, I THINK THAT WATCHING ANY KIND OF SPORTS IS USELESS BECAUSE IT IS NOT A GOOD THING. THERE ARE MANY THINGS TO DO INSTEAD OF IT. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN DO SPORT IN REAL LIFE OR READ SOMETHING IMPORTANT. IT IS MORE HELPFUL FOR YOUR HEALTH AND MIND.
