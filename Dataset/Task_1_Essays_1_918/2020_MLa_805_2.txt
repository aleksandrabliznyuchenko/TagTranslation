The issue is connected to the topic of enjoying sports. Some people content that is better participate in competitions themselves. They say, it makes no sence to watch sports. However, they are those who insist of idea of getting pleasure from it.
In my opinion, watching sports is a useless way of time sparing. Firstly, you do not feel emotions from doing physically exercises. Actually, it might be important for somebody to feel that they are strong enough to do some sport. Secondly, you do not benefit from do sports if you only watching it, You cannot improve your own physical form. Still there are those who tend to think otherwise. Most people do enjoy watching sports due the fact that it is entertaining. Moreover, they are too lazy to try themselves in doing sports. Due to this reason such as people prefer to create the feeling of belonging to sport watching it.
Despite all facts to my opinion, I agree with them. Sitting in front of the TV or being a spectator has nothing to do with real sport. In addition, it is absolutely useless things, because you wiil not feel the real atmosphere not being a participation of action.
To sum it up, I would like to say that sport not field my life. I believe, that sports it is a way of living, so you should do it yourselves.
