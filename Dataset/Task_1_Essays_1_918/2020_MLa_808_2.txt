A lot of people find it interesting to watch sport shows. Some of them are included in fan groups and travel the world to support their favourite team. I beleive that this type of leisure can be worthy and even may encourage people to do some sport by themselves.
Firstly, children tend to be fans of superstars. A lot of boys love Cristiano Ronaldo or Alexander Ovechkin and goes to the football or hockey team for being more similar with their idols. This leads to popularity of sport itself and more healthy lifestyle as a consequence.
Secondly, lots of adults are ready to spend a lot of money and time to support their preferrable teams on real competitions. In the world cups there are crowds of international fans singing songs of their language for supporting. Such events can be really facsinating and obviously people from all over the world meet and connect each other on them.
Finally, lots of people love to watch sport with their family and friends and we have nice pubs and bars specialised on sport. Friends spend hours there talking to each other and watching TV together. Nowadays, sport events can be really helpful to connect.
In conclusion, I think that watching sport shows is not that bad and can be interesting and useful for people of all ages and all over the world.
