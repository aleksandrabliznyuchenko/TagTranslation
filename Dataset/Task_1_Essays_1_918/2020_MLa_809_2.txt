It is true that some people think that watching sports is a waste of time. But I disagree with this opinion, because I believe that watching sports on TV or at live events has is advantages.
On the one hand, it can help you relax after work or study, if you are interested in sports, but you don't have the strenght to go to play yourself. Also it's a great occasion to get together with friends to cheer on your favourite teams. This helps to avoid emotional overload or depression, and in out time this is very important, because the level of stress in the modern world is off the scale.
On the other hand, instead of just watching the competition, you can take part in it yourself. It will be good for your health and body. But not everyone has the ability, for example, volleyball or may not health. For example, if you have bad knees, you should not play football, volleyvall or basketball. During these games, there is a very heavy load in the legs, especially on the knees, and can end up with an injury for live. A lot of sportsmen now suffer from life-long injuries because they didn't stop playing sports in time. In conclusion, I don't quite agree that qatching sports is a waste of time, because it can a help a person psychologically reboot or not get harm to their health, if you are interested in sports that you can not do.
