Sports is not only serious job, it is very popular entartaining for most people. Not of all success to watch that kind of competitions in real life and watching sports on TV are good opportunity or change for the community, who are eager about sport. I think this hobby is interesting and exiting. Every person should have a hobby, sport's events is good idea for spending free time. On the one hand, i think this kind of interest is cool. You have something besides your job and daily routine which make you happier. For example, some families in Spain have tradition watching footballs with all members and relatives. Football in Spain is national kind of sport, and all people are desired abot it. They playing on the beaches and on the streets, football make them closely and opened to each other. It units all generation, keeps staying alive. On the other hand, a range of people are not interested in watching sport's competition. They don't have interest, they just see the results and read short story of match. Obviosly, they can spend time with more uses - to read the book or watch films. For example, russians fans of football joke that "There no sense to watch competition Russia with somebody. All is clear".
Both opinions have right to exist. In my opinion, sports is good hobby which units fans and present people unforgetable emotions.
