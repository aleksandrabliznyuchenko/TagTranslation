The graphs below are showing the differencies of using Facebook between men and women in the timing of 2012 and 2013 years. There are some main differences and some similarities between men and women, which we are going to consider.
The first graph shows the difference in types of using Facebook, including both, men and women. It shows, that in 2012 people were using the dekstop as the main source of searching for facebook, but in 2013, the mobile phones began growing fast in being used as the replacement to the laptop. We can see, that the number of millions of users in 2012, using laptop was almost 3 times higher, in comparison of people using their phones to spend time on facebook. But in 2013, phones began their growth and increased their importance in people lives.
As we see further, we are given the graph of classification of the reasons, people are using Facebook. The only similarity here is that both, men and women consider receiving the new information as important way of using Facebook, but there are other opinions, where the number of women is higher, than men. Here comes the correlation between 2 graphs. The number of mobile phone users increased, as people (especially women), are using Facebook for sharing photos, watching funny posts and helping others. As times goes, it is not comgortable for people to use a computer, as they take photos on their phones, try to help people through phones and watching funny things is easier by phone, while one is not at home.
