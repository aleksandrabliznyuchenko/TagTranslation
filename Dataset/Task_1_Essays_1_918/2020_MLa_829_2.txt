Some people believe that watching sports is a waste of time. I disagree with this statement. Let's see both points of view of this situation.
Firstly, watch sports only those people, who have free time and love sports. I know a lot of people, who just like watching football at the free time, no more. They just like football, they are not fascinated. But, for example, my granddad, was always watching football. He was running from his job home, sat, turned on the TV and started to watch a football match but at the same time, he was one of the best workers at his job. He did not overwork, he was a normal worker with official work time, with good salary, etc. He just could not live without football.
Secondly, if we go into phylosophy, nothing is a waste of time. Concerning sports, there is a vice versa situation. Sports motivate people to do sports, to look after themselves, to make their bodies fit. It is much more useful than smoking a cigarette with your "friends", who taught you that.
Last but not least, I kind of understand, why some people think that sports is a waste of time. Some real fans of any football or basketball team, can leave his job whenever he wants and to go to the stadium to watch a match of his favorite team live. But, in this life we always have "but"! I know a lot of people, who often go to the football stadium and watch matches there and there are good students, pupils, adults. They study as good as before they started to be interested in sports.
Summing up everything, I think that sports can not be a waste of time because sports always give you a motivation to act as your favorite spotsman.
