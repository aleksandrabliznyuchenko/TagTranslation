Some people think that watching sports is a waste of time. I am not so interested in sports but I still do not agree with this statement.
First of all wathing sports on TV or at live sports events is a sort of entertainment. There is nothing wrong with having a good time watching content of your interest. Yes, some people can say that instead one should play sports themselves then just sit and watch it. And this is a good point, but one who enjoys watching sports can also be practicing it in the same time. Most people may not have enough time for everything, so they can watch sports after work or studying to relaks and in weakends for example play their favourit sports and have some fun.
In both those activities I do not see any useless actions. Because of that I can say that watching sport is great way to spend your free time.
