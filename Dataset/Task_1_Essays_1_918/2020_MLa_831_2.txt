There is an opinion in a present society, that consider sports watching as a waste of time. I strongly disagree with such an opinion and I will explain why.
First of all, watching sports can be considered as a interesting hobby. People around the world can always find a topic to discuss, when the conversation turn to recent sports matches on TV discussion. There is a wide community of people, that meet together in small companies of friends or in big sports club events, examing the sports of their interests. The sports fans can study sports theory, strategy, or just support the sports team that they like, but most of people started grom gaining interest in some sport demonstration on a TV. For example, every time during the Olimpic games, a lot of people around the world meet in pubs or clubs with friends and track the success of their own national teams, examing the failtures, mistakes and strategy of the players.
Secondary, watching sports is similar to physical activity enlightment. There is a lot of international competitions, that unites whole world when the competition transfigures on TV. A sports broadcasting is stimulating the peope to start a healthy life by rising up the interest in physical activities. For example, when the company of friends watch the sport competition, whey will try to copy the professional players maneuvers and, probably, play a long game and get some sport as a main hobby.
In conclusion, watching sports stimulate the whole world society to participate in active lifestyle and socialization as a side effects, and it point of my opinion, that the benefit of sports watching out of question.
