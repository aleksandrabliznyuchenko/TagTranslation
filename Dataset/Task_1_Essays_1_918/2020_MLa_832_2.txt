There is a number of people that believe that watching sports is a waste of time. I, personally, share that opinion and find such an activity very boring. However, different people have different opinions and this question is not simple.
On one hand, there is an opinion that it is better to do sports than to watch them. For me it is rather challenging not to go and play football in the moment of watching it via TV because of inner exctitement and how overall fun it is. On the contrary a few people do sports aside from watching them, that is why for many people it is considered as a waste of time because such person could do sports and master their own skills by simply leaving a couch.
However, we should not forget about other part of such sport events. Usually they are held only once a year and it is a big event for many people. We can rarely see such professionals playing on a big arena not only to get a prize, but to protect country's reputation. Also these events can be viewed as an option for gathering together like coffee shoops in Monday morning, which is used not only to get a cup of coffee but to socialization too. That is why even if you enjoy doing sports yourself more, watching it can be worth a shot because it can gather family or friends together.
To conclude, i rarely enjoy watching sports and a lot of people are like me, however sports and events which are translated on TV can vary.
