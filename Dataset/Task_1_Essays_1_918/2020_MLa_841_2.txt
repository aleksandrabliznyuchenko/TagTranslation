There are a lot of people all over the world who understand that sport events play an important part in their life. While others consider it to be a waste of time. That is why this question is still being debated.
I do not fully agree with this statement, as I consider that sport events are very helpful in everyday life. On the one hand, the main idea of such events is to gather people together around the world. That is why there are a lot of great events in any season of a year. For example, the Olympic games that gather people from the whole world not only in one country, but also near computer or TV screens. Another example is the World Cup in Russia in 2018, that showed that our country can lead such kind of events on a high level ana also helped the country to gain support and respect on international arena. And by watching this football competition the younger generation looks at these icons on the pitch and wants to be like them. Another example is that sportsmen can be an example of a man, so that people with some health problems start to do the fitness or go to the gym to kip fit.
On the other hand, people can find more interesting businesses rather than watching some kind of sport events. For example, people can be more interested in their hobbies. So, they fully enjoy their way of spending time even without some sport events.
in conclusion, I would like to say that I cannot fully agree with this statement, as I understand both sides. However, watching sports have its own benefits, while not watching it has another advantages. And this situation gives people a wide range of things they can prefer more.
