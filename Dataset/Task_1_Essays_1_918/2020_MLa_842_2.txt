Whether watching sport events is useless is a controversial question. I personally believe it is not a waste of time, but a tool of self-development, and have number of arguments to support my point of view.
First of all, it is common knowledge that sport, no matter what kind, contributes to the development of analytical skills and logistics. While watching a game of football or witnessing chess competition, we try to predict the result of any move we see on the field or on the table. Many people do not realize that criticism also plays its role in skills development, as when people criticize, they think about how would they act under given conditions and analyze what is the best way to win a game.
Secondly, watching sports live or recorder gives an excellent opportunity for adrenaline rush. It is extremely good for health to bust adrenaline in order to keep organist fit and balanced. While watching a tense game, we tend to support certain team and therefore to worry about the outcome of a game. Many people say that they feel relaxed after screaming from tribunes, they even sleep better.
To put it in a nutshell, sport is a good way to keep fit. It works in both ways, whether you are participating yourself or trying your best to support those who are playing.
