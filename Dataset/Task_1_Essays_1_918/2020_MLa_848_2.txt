Nowadays there is a huge debate whether watching sports game on TV or in real life. Some people believe that there is nothing bad about being satisfied by watching sport games, whereas other states it can be rather pointless activity. For the purpose of this essay, I will compare both sides of the argue and present my point of view.
In my personal opinion, watching sports on TV or in real life is not a waste of time. First of all, by watching some sports like swimming or yoga, people can relax after a hard day at work. Professors from the University of Michigan conducted a survey, in which 8 out of 10 respondents confirmed the beneficial impact of watching sport games on their mental health, as it relaxes their neuro system. Moreover, in some countries, monitoring sport games is a full-time job. For instance, in Australia, there is a large group of people who works in public administration and help Ministry of Sports to guide the perfomance of local sportsmen, hence, they recieve rather big salaries and provides government with a helpful information. Lastly, watching sports for disabled people or individuals with different kinds of injuries can be beneficial, as it is the only way for them to participate in such activities.
Nonetheless, some people believe that watching sports is a waste of time, because people can do sports by themselves instead. In addition, some researches state that watching sports on TV can be harfmul for individual's health, as it irritates their eyes, yet it was not confirmed. Moreover, some people claim there is a high risk of mental damage for people who enjoys wathcing sport games, such as box, since they may become more cruel and unstable afterwards.
To sum it all, I believe it is not true. A regular, but not a constant watching sports can be beneficial, as it reduces the stress level, helps to observe new information and gives and ability to participate for people without an opportunity to be involved in sport activities.
