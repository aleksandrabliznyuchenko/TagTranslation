It is sometimes said that those who watch sports broadcasting on TV or visit real sports events waste their time. I fully disagree with this statement as I believe that watching such shows not only lets people spill out their emotions and feel better afterwards, but also inspires them to start exercising.
First of all, visiting a live sports event is a perfect way to get rest from the routine we have. It might be going to another city or even country with your friends to see your favorite sports team or sportsman in real life. Sports fans are always easy-going, therefore it is a chance to meet new people with the same mindset. Going to another country gives opportunities to learn a lot about the culture, meet local citizens and make friends, moreover, this is a way to practice English or some other language with native speakers.
Even if you watch a sports event on TV, this can not be a waste of time as long as you enjoy the process. Watching football with your friends and drinking beer might not be the best choice, however, a biathlon race is breathtaking when you are a skier and are going to take part in a local race tomorrow. Some kinds of sports are just pleasant to watch: for example, ultimate frisbee is exciting: when you see a player throwing the disk to another end of the field with a slight shake of his hand, or another one lay out in the air to catch the frisbee, you can not just keep sitting, you want to get up and at least do some push-ups to prove that you can be an athlete too.
To sum up, I firmly believe that watching sports events either on TV or in real life is not a waste of time as long as you track your watching time and as long as the process brings joy and motivation.
