Nowadays sport has become an integral part of human life. People often argue whether or not watching sport is useless part-time activity. Personally I cannot agree with this opinion as attending sport events of watching them on television have a lot of benefits.
Firstly, from a psychological point of view visiting sport events or watching them in different pubs or cafes helps people to bond together because feelings and emotions are known to be the best remedy to make people closer. Which, in turns, contributes to building new friendships and developing communications. As an example, this year due to COVID-19 lots of people are captured in their homes and watching sports online helps them to be a part of big human community and feel like old good days without lockdown and epidemic. Secondly, watching sport make people lead an athletic lifestyle because true sport fans want to live their lives as their sport idols as they want look like them or to act like them. Therefore, watching or attending sporting events motivates, people to begin doing sports, which undoubtedly has a positive impact on their life and health.
However, there are people who can disagree with me opinion. They insist what brain training is more useful way to spend your time because mind is more valuable than muscles. I can't agree with such opinion because human is perfect creature. That's why everything should be in balance.
To summarise, I would like to say that attending live sporting events or watching them on television is definitely not a waste of time as it has many positive effects on people, which we explored above.
