There are two diagrams showing the changes in using Facebook between female and male in 2012 and 2013. It is shown that both men and women surfed Facebook by using desktop more in 2012 than in 2013 when they did it by mobiles. Due to the statistics we can notice that there was a trend that women used the social net more for the enjoyment and entertainment rather than for business deals. Besides, women in comparison to men tended to share more photos or videos in 15 percent. Otherwise they have the same number (39 per cent) of receiving updates. It is stable for both. The graph shows that surfing for funny posts prone to women society as they did it more than man in 8 per cent. Also women were more likely to see some material how to help others in the nets oftener than men. The difference was in 10 percent. In the conclusion it needs to be said that female main reasons are not more for work while men preferred to use the net for communication and business. All in all the graph shows that statistics was almost the same for both.
