Nowadays it is thought to believe that watching sports is an inappropriate way to send your time. I would like to share my opinion in this debate. There are advantages in the first paragraph and cons in the second.
First of all, I am sure that watching sports can inspire people to do it. They feel encouraged to be fit and active. For instance, there were so many sport programs on TV that people tried to follow their examples and were fond of doing it. Due to the statics, people tended doing the sport on regular basis more than nowadays. The second argument is that sometimes it is really breathtaking and exciting when you watch your favorite team on the stadium and suffer both good and poor emotions with it. So it is useful to pay your attention to international championships or tournament in order to have exhilarating mood. Besides, visiting live sport events can be a good chance for dating. It is a wonderful opportunity to cheer up the team and enjoy the atmosphere of the stadium, the sense of competition and attractive athletic bodies. It can be done despite political or religious beliefs and help to create good relationship. So community bonding is the advantage of watching sport while bringing them together.
However, sometimes it seems that people watching sport events either online or offline just escape from reality. They are lying in front of one-eyed monsters all days and nights. This waste of time can be resulted in obesity and unwillingness to enhance life conditions.
To conclude, watching sport is not a waste of time. I am certain that it is evident for people to watch sport programs in free time as it helps to motivate them to have healthier lifestyle and engage in physical activity.
