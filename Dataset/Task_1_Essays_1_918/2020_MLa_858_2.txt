Today sport remains one of the most important parts of people's life. Some people prefer play sports while others find watching sport games a best way of entertainment. I frimly agree that being a fan and watching sport is a useful and presious past-time and will try to prove it in my essay.
The first point which is need to be considered is that following sports events on TV or at the stadium can be a real nice past-time for friends and family. For instance, chearing your favourite team unites people and make them closer. This way you will have shared intesest with your family and friends no matter where are they working or what character they have. For example, my grandfather and I chear up the same football team though we have a great age gap.
Another important reason for supporting watchin sports is that it can be helpful for the health of the chearleaders. According to researches, fans waist a lot of callories while actively chearing their teams - clapping, jumping and shouting. In addition, this past-time always brings joy for the deliberate fans which helps to produce adrenaline and helps the longlivety.
Any view must be taken into consideration. Some people say that watching sports can be called a waiste of time because of high prices on the stadiums. They claim that people pay enormous money, spend a lot of time there and still can not look at their favourite sportsmen closely. I dissagree with this oppinion because suggest that people pay for the atmosphere of the sport event, which can be calles a unique experience.
To conclude, I want to point out that visiting sports events live or watching them on TV can be called a great past-time activity. It builds the sence of unity, raise spirit and health and brings up amazing memories which can be kept for a very long time.
