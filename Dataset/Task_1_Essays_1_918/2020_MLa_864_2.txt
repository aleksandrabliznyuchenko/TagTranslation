Some people believe that watching sport TV shows is useless hobby, others don't agree with this statement, for them watching sports is an attractive variant for the time spending. Anyway, sport is an essential part of the human being, sport helps us to develop our body shape and it's really popular nowadays in the groups of adults and children as well. But people thought it would be more interesting and cool to translate the sport games on the TV. As for me, I don't find the process of watching sports satisfying.
I understand the first point of view, where people prefer to watch sport channels and I can explain many reasons why do they like it.
Firstly, people used to watch sports for a thousands of years, for example ancient Olympic games, so now we can say that it is like the World's cultural tradition that can't be stopped and named a wasting of time. Secondly, it is a big topic for the discussion between the people, you can have a big talk with your friends or family about the beautiful play of Leo Messi or the great win of Maria Sharapova. Thirdly, watching sports is becoming useful theory practice for those who may have inspiration by it, then they just need to start phisically practising and do their favorite sport.
As I said in the beginning - now I'm not interested in sport TV shows and there are several arguments. There is the fact that in the childhood I was a big football fan and used to visit every single stadium match with my dad, I loved the real fan atmosphere and the feeling of the community with other people, also it is more healthier to spend your time on the fresh air but not to sitting behind the TV and gaining the weight.
In conclusion, I'd say that there are a lot of opinions and everyone has the rights on them, but the sport shows stay not so interesting for me.
