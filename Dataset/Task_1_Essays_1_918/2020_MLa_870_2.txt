It is said that watching sports is the useless activity. This essay will consider arguments for and against this point of view.
In the beginning, it is necessary to notice that there are different reasons for watching sports on TV or on other online platforms. A lot of people are fond of sport. At the same time not everyone can visit all desirable sports' events. That is why it is important for them to follow last news due to TV or the Internet. Moreover, sometimes watching sports could be a type of entertainment. People get different emotions while they are watching football or tennis. It gives the opportunity to distract from daily routine and to be involved in exciting competition. Watching sports provides extra motivation to work harder and more.
On the other hand, when you are just a viewer, you do not improve your sport skills and you do not influence on the results of game. It is undeniable that watching sports do not lead you to any achievements. Real sport allows you to reveal you own phisycal possibilities and to get positive emotions due to this activity which is not compared with emotions from watching sports.
All in all, I believe that people should choose watching sports or not by themselves. As for me, I prefer spending active leisure and play tennis with my friend instead of sitting in front of TV screen.
