Some people consider watching sports as an useless action. I oppose this oppinion and my reasons will be discussed in following paragraphs.
As far as I am concerned, I believe, that watching sports is not a waste of time, but an activity that can be very healthy for your mind. To start with, I would like ta say, that for doing sports prifessionally a person needs to be strong mentally as well as physically and work hard in order to succed. Which means that sport events, especially that of such high quality like Olympic games, demonstrate that any person can achieve anyything. The message of sport is clear - there are no impossibilities, the only thing you need to do is try. And this moto is extremely helpful in an every-day life. Moreover, watching sports may incourage a viewer to do sports by themself. And this is with no doubt a healty result.
Regarding watching sports on-line or on TV, I can say, there are a lot of programmes, that do not only show events, but have an educational aspect too. Some of them have an introduction with a brieth history of different kinds of sport. In other cases, there may be lecturers who explain human anatomy and the way our bodies work during sport.
And last, but not least, watching sports can be a great way of human interactions or building relationships. While doing this together, people have very valuable moments of shareing emotions, which is a basic need of our brains.
All in all, I would like to say, that I still stick to the opinion that watching sports is not a waste of time, but sometimes even a necessary action.
