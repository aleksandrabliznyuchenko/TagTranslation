Soccer matches, Olympic games and other sport events remained extremely popular throughout the history. Nowadays they also not only may be attended live but are widely broadcasted on television which only increased their popularity. But watching sports and not actually participating in them are often considered useless. I completely disagree, such activity, while going against the original aim of sports, is actually really interesting and can be called a good hobby.
Firstly, watching sports games as a form of leisure is extremely relaxing and fun. It also often takes place with either family and friends or in a huge enthusiastic crowd - for example, at the stadium. Loved ones nearby, shared interest, delicious food and drinks - sounds like a good evening recipe to me, if you ask.
Another point to consider is that being interested in various kinds of sport events may not be connected with an intention for participating in them at all. People find dozens of reasons for amusement in them. For example, soccer matches are not only games of trained legs and running. They are also games of minds, strategies and tactics. Hence it provides an ability for intelligent connoisseurs to analyze them and predict a certain exodus. There are also people who place bets on certain match scores, players or teams. So being invested in watching sports events may benefit not only your brain but also your financial condition.
In conclusion, an enthusiasm for being a viewer on sports events can not be considered as a waste of time and other resources because people can profit from it and, at the end of the day, just have a good time.
