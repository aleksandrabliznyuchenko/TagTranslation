There are two point on the topic that watching sport is a waste of time. There is important to note that this opinion spread either on TV or sports events. I think that there are a lot of useful things that people can do during their free time. On the other hand, there is point of view that the wathching sport can helps humans to become better that they are.
To start with, the disscusing amoung the profits of the wathching sport on TV or at live sports events is too long. I am sure that the wathching sports makes ours health not better and the governmant lose a lot of money that they can use for helpness to society. For instance, when people just watch and set in the front of TV or on live sport events they do not move. They can set from 2 to 5 hours and do not do any exercise. It is awful and very bad for the health. Overall, the sport that people watch need a lot of money. As a result, the governmant follow the audience's needs of the entertament to spend from 5 to 20 billions dollars to the sport. These money governmant can spend on the charity.
On the other hand, there are people who sure that the watching sport is the importatnt part not only of the modern society but the strong tradition of the human history. For example, the Olimpic games was created a long time ago and still it is very popular amoung modern society. They argue that the watching sports is very important for human overall. What is more, they sure that this type of entertament helps people to feel thamselves as a part of the nation. The games illustratse what nation better of doing the kind sport.
To sum up, I am keen on that watching sport is the not good thing not only for the audience health, but also for the economic issues. The better help not to people that has TV and opportunity to buy tickets, but to people that has nothing.
