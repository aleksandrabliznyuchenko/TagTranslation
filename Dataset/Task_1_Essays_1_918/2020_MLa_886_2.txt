Some people believe that watching sports on TV or live sports events is a waste of time. I absolutely agree with this opinion. In this essay i will try to demonstrate that people can use their time more wise. First of all, during the watching sports a person do not anything that can help to develop in some cases. Person only see how other people are playing the game. What is more, in case of health people between the TV screen do not be healthy then players. For example, for people who do some exercises every day, more chances that the they will be live longer. It is always sad, but time for us on this planet is limited and people should choose carefully what they are doing now.
Secondly, all games involved your feelings and in the most variants there are negative. Competition is what a base of most of the games. Anger and aggression do not help to feel you more happy then before you are. For example, scientist says that those who prefer to be more positive and do not express some negatives one probably will live longer. All emotions that we have during the day, moth etc depends on our health.
To conclude, to my mind, it is a waste of time to watching sports on TV or live sports events. During this time you have more opportunities to be more health, educated and so on. There are a lot of variants to spend this time wisely. As for me, it is more comfortable to play some sport games with friends.
