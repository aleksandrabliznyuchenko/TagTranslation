Some people claim that watching sports on TV or going to live sports events in your free time is not the good way to spend it. I totally disagree with this point of view. In my opinion, a person could benefit from this kind of activities.
To start with, watching sports with your friends is one of the best ways to get a team spirit, that is unreachable in day-to-day life, and become even closer with each other. A sports game is the best way to get to know people, even during the first meeting. It is easy to tell a lot about the characteristics of the person by the way how they react.
Furthermore, watching sports games can be cultivating and expanding the mind, but only if the person is watching it wisely, analysing the moves of players. During the time we watch sports games, we gain knowledge more quickly, therefore it is a better way to understand the rules than just hearing about them. Also one can get motivation from his or hers favourite sports idols and get a boost in developing own characteristics: starting to eat more healthy or doing more exercises. For instance, in my childhood, I was amazed by Olympic runners, whose race I watched on TV, they became my role models and became my motivation to start running long distances. It turned into my favourite hobby for a several years, that took a participation in forming my personal characteristics. Stories about hard work, that leads a person to success, are always a reason to be the best version of yourself.
In conclusion, watching sports is not only a pleasant way to spend your free time, but it is also the useful one, so people should invest more their time in these kinds of activities.
