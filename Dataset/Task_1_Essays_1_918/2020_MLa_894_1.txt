The charts reveal differences in the use of social network Facebook in 2012 and 2013 and the reason why different sexes use it. I am going to sum up the information and make comparisons where needed.
According to the first chart, the number of Facebook users grown from 210 millions of users in 2012 to 240 millions in 2013. More people began to use mobile app for Facebook but stiil desktop version had more users. As for the second chart, the most popular reason for using Facebook is sharing photos or videos. In all four charts women have more percentage for reasons why they use this social network and only one chart telling about receiving updates have the same pecent of men and women.
All in all, I would like to say that these two charts may be connected. The first chart reveals the growth of use of mobile app whereas the secong tells us about big interest in sharing photos and videos on Facebook. Also, these charts show the growing interest to Facebook and especially among women who are more socially active.
