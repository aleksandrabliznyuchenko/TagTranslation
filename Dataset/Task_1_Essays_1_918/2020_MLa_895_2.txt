It is some kind of leisure to watch sports on TV or alive. I am convinced that it is nothing wrong in idea to spend time in this way while other people do not see any profit for themselves in this. What are pros and cons in watching sports?
First of all, sport is a part of culture. It means that everyone who identifies himself as a member of our or another society must a little bit know about sports popular in his society. Secondly, watching sports is a good way to spend time with your family or friends. Even if you do not like football you can enjoy sharing emotions with your close people. Finally, for some people watching such beautiful kinds of sport like gymnastics makes happy. It is a way to relax for them.
On the other hand, there are bad examples in the history when watching sports included murders. Such examples are popular in old civilizations like Roman empire or Empire of Inks, but it is not actual for us. Also, most people watching sport can do this too much often. It means that these people spend too much time to watch TV while must do something else.
To sum up, watching sport is meaningful for our everyday life because it helps us to relax or to be a part of society while it do not take too much time and is normal for our society.
