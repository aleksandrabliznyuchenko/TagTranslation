In the contemporary world it is a wide-spread belief that spectating of sport events on the various media resourses is usless and time-consuming. I am complitely agree with this statemant, due to the fact that, from mine point of view, it is better to take part rather than watch. Moreover, I am concerned that both TV and real life provides a huge amount of more interesting programmes and occasions.
First of all, I believe that watching sport on TV or at live sport events is not as good for health as being involved in the action by yourself or at least doing excercises. In other words, it is more beneficial for ones health to visit GUM instead of being a TV-spectator. As the resent survy of Moscow State University shows, people spending over six hours per week on doing sport activities are by 45 percent less likely to face health issuse, than those, who do not.
Furthermore, professional sport is a field of narrow interests, due to this fact one is able to find more preferable TV-shows and occasions, such as visiting cinema, theatre or a music concert. For instans, most part of my friends and family members usually give their preferances to cultural events and TV-programms rather than to sport related ones.
To conclude everything, which was mantioned above, I am strongly agree with the claim that watching sport is not productive. In my humble opinion, it is less beneficial for health than taking part in the sport events by yourself and not as interesting as TV-shows and occasions related to the culture.
