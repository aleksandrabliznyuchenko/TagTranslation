Sometimes it is thought that watching sports is completely useless and only wastes one's time. I completely disagree with this position and I am going to prove that it is, controversially, rather beneficial.
To begin with, keeping up with sport translations and live events does help to relieve stress. To elaborate on that, watching sports make us fade away from everyday problems and thus make us less concerned about the latter. The cheer and excitement of sporting competitions gives us adrenaline buzz and plunges into the world of high attainments and moving moments. For example, how could anybody worry about their obnoxious boss when they are gripped by the harsh fight of eminent boxers? Still, some people may consider this process as locking oneself in the ivory tower, but it is irrelevant since everybody needs to forget about some of their difficulties every now and then.
What is more, watching sport significantly contributes to the general motivation of ordinary people. By observing contender's immediate success in the competition and contemplating his story before that jubilant moment and what has helped him to be where he is now, we learn from a good example. If there are, for instance, some problems with one's carrier or hobbies, they may look up to the famous sportsmen who are surmounting all the obstacles throughout the game or competition, and therefore feel more encouraged to persevere doing sth difficult and unreal at first sight themselves.
To conclude, on no account is observing sport pointless, for it helps people feel less stressed and anxious and gives them motivation for dealing with their own difficulties.
