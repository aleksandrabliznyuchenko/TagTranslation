It is argued that interest for watching sports events on TV or at real live is worst way to spend your free time. It is a contraversial issue, but i am convinced that it is false at all, cause watching sport is great And it is good option to deal with your social phobia and the best way to improve your critical mind. 61 Firstly, spot is not only a game, more than that sport is really huge community. Football, swimming or backetball atract a hundreds of funs all around the world. Watching sports at a live sport event gives you an opportunity to make new friends and to fell real spirit of fan groups. Maybe such things can help someone to aviod his or her social problems in communication. This statement can be ilustrated by a recent research from Bamberg University which found that more than 70% of sport fans are more friendly and easy to communicate then other groups of people.
Secondly, sport can helps you to improve your mind. It means that every type of sport game has it own stratigy, which is their key for victory. But idea of stradigy is not vital for sport only. It is important for daily routine too. That is why watching sport games could help you to find some features of critical mind and to build your own strtigy.
