It is argued that to watch TV sport is useless and people just waste their time. I agree with that statement and going to give some argument for supporting my opinion.
Firts of all, it is all reall18y useless time, people do not get anything useful information. In the modern world we have the internet and access to international libraries, some interestiong scientific TV programms. Even if a person is tired after difficult workind day, he can find something what will relax and at the same time learn new information. To watch TV programms anout animals or historical events, at least about anything what can make our brains to work and think.
Secondly, people can be addicted. During this quarantin a lot of online causion and online sport debts are developingP and definately, t is really popular right now. People play and make debts and as we know it can make an addiction. Unfortunatelly, sometimes they do not win but these players want more amd more and then they will lose their house. In the bad case a homeless is the near future. The thirs but nor last reason is online sport can make pople be lazier. Watching sport competititons online people enjoy it sitiion the chair. maube theu will not see any good reason to go and olay, for example, on football with their friends.
In conclusin, we can see that online sport is not the best thing and better to go to spend free time watching something useful or go to walk with friends.
