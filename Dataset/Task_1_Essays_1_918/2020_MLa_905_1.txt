The charts illustrates data about tendencies in using Facebook during the period from 2012 to 2013 and also point out why men and women have chosen it.
Overall, what stands out from the figures is that in March 2013 the number of people people using Facebook by mobile was pretty less than users of desktop. And this is also worth mentioning that tendencies in surfing Facebook because of a number of reasons like sharing photos and videos or seeing funny posts are rather different among women and men.
Looking at the details, we can notice that such device as desktop was used for surfing Facebook by over 140 million of people in March 2012, while one year later this proportion decreased just under about 10 million. Moreover, there is a dramatical difference in numbers of people who use mobile phones because it doesn't rise higher than about 90 million of people, whereas the most little number is between 40 and 60 million. As for the reasons of using Facebook, it can be noticed that tendency of choosing them fluctuated among men (between 35 and 54%) but not among women, whose choice is rather similar in all the categories (from 25 to 39%).
