Watching sport has been a popular way of time amusement for decades, although the opponents of such hobby exist among supporters, believing that spending time this way is valueless. There are convincing arguments on both sides, however, I strongly believe that such practise is not useless or harmless, but even helpful.
Starting with negative potential effects of watching sport, some might say that many people prefer to watch sport along with the others in the place such pubs or stadions. Thus, it can commit physical violence among with the savage fans and it might be a not a good idea to spend your own time and money like that in terms of being possibly hurted by furious or even drunk people. Secondly it is not a secret that such watching is usually accompained by snacks and, as it was aforementioined, alcohol. That is the reason, why huge fans are bound to gain weight and have problems with their health.
Althought, there are a number of arguments in favour of spending people's time on sport. Firstly, it is a possibility to feel the spirit of the big community of people, whether people watch matches in local pubs with friends and neghbours or in the big stadions with other strangers. Moreover, wearing the outfit and merchandise of their team increases the national pride well. Also, huge fans are known for their willingness to follow theit teams around the country or even world, wich definetly boosts sport tourism and international sport events everywhere. The last but not the least, being able to just express emotions while seeing succes of fails of the team helps to deal with the stress and take edge off after a busy day.
Even though there are both sides, I condemn those who might take watching sport as a useless aumusement. I am of opinion, that it is good part of everyday's life that brings mostly positive emotions.
