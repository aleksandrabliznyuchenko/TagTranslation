One of the modern opinion about watching sports is that it is not usefull at all. I disagree with people who think so because sport is part of our life, and watching it on TV or at live sports events is a way to be connected with that part.
Paying attetion to sport competition is also can provide some abilities for searching a hobby. Every man in the world wants to have some private life for interests and wishes, and being a sport-fan is one of way to add something unusual in everyday life. For example, me uncle had a dead-end job when he was a adolescent, and supporting our local football team was his way to demolish a tension. He was becoming happier after every match, and even if his hobby did not provide ane financual benefits, it provided a lot of good emotions.
Watching sports is also one of the way to tackling a problem with low level of physical activity. A lot of people have a sedentary lifestyle, and they need to be provoked for some work outs. If parents will watch some footbal or hochey match with their children, it can be a good step in developing child' sport-interest. There a lot of more chances that little boy will want to go in some sport sections if he will associate sport with something interesting and connecting to his family. For example, some football and hockey clubs provide a sales for family tickets and create tours around and inside theit stadions in purpose to catch children's interest.
The opposite opinion has some strong arguments too. For example, someone can say that a lot of people will prefer just watching sport from home, thus they will have one more reason for countiune their sedentary lifestyle. However, this problem can be solved by some pull factors. For example, more advertisment about healthy lifestyle and some interesting active programm for adults.
In conclusion I would like to say that sport is important part of out everyday life. Watching it can be a good hobby and it can solve problem with unactive way of life.
