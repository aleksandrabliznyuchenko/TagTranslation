There are shown two charts. They contain the information about using Facebook in 2012-2013 among men and woman and about their reasons for it. Let's take a look and analyse these two charts.
In general, we can see the difference between men's and women's using Facebook. The amount of people using this social network is changing through time if we compare the data of 2012 and the data of 2013. Also it is seen that women are using Facebook generally more the man. Let's talk about each chart in more detail.
The first chart is about how many users of Facebook are. The amount of them splits between two devices which are used for that. We talk about desktop and mobile. If we compare using desktop for access to Facebook, we can notice that their numbers changed from 150 millions to less than 140 millions (135 maybe). At the same time using of mobile phones are strongly increased from less than 60 millions to nearly 100 millions.
Now let's take a look at the other chart. It shows us difference between women's and men's using Facebook depending on their reasons. In general, amount of woman is more almost in every graph. The one exception is labeled as "Receiving updates". There is equal amount of women and men.
