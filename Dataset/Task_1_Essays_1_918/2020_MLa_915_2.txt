There is a widespread knowledge that watching sports is not a valuable spending of time. I presume, that there are more benefits for enjoying sports on TV and in real life and there are several reasons for this.
First of all, watching sports may be appropriate for teens while they are looking for future career. Thus, by seeing examples of successful sportsmen they might also be attended to sport and become real professionals. Take Evgenia Medvedeva for instance. She is one of the greatest examples of figure skaters and is a role model for younger girls and boys.
Secondly, not only does watching sports improves physical skills but also help non-professional learners to find an inspiration to work as hard as they can. These means that regularly watching at professionals may reveal the secrets of their technique and help learners to improve their abilities. Furthermore, the watching of sports on television or in real life might be helpful for those, who loose their motivations. Saing it in another words. for those who usually train individually might be helpful to see the improvement, the professional level and the success of competeters in order to find motivation to work twice time hard.
Summing up all the above, the fact of watching sports online or in real life is quite a debatable one. Still I stick to the opinion that it is rather helpful for beginners to enjoy sport, because they may improve their skills and inspire for further work. Otherwise, it is very important to accumulate all profits.
