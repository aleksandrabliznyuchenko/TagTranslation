The given charts show the trend of Facebook usage from desktop to mobile version between 2012 and 2013 and mention users' reasons for applying Facebook. The key point is that a significant amount of traffic switched from the desktop usage to the mobile one in one year (from 2012 to 2013).
While the total amount of Facebook usage increased in 2013 compared to the previous year, it is obviously that the desktop use decreased from around 150 millions to around 135 millions of users in 2012 and 2013 respectively. It is probably connected with the growth of smartphones' impact on the society in 2013. Speaking about mobile version, Facebook usage increased dramatically from around 55 millions of users in 2012 to around 95 millions of users in 2013 that is 50% more than in a previous year. In contrast, there is a quite stable chart about reasons for using Facebook among women and men. It is a common knowledge that women are more likely to use social media because of the entertainment content so as it is shown in the chart sharing pictures and seein funny posts is more popular among women as well as learning about ways to help others. But there is one reason that is uniformly popular between both women and men - receiving updates.
