Sport is one of the main parts of our life. Some of us like playing sports while others prefer to watch it. Besides, some people believe that watching sports is time-wasting. To my mind, sports watching could be beneficial sometimes.
Some people cannot choose which sport they want to go in or play. This is the problem mostly of young teenagers or children. Due to young age they did not have an ability to try different sport activities, that is why sports watching is a great opportunity for them to choose what kind of sports they want to do. Moreover, it is also beneficial for parents who want their children to be interesed in sports.
Another important benefit is that watching or visiting sports events could bring you new friends and meetings while where are people with the same interests as you in sports bar or at the stadium where sport events are held. Moreover, it is a great opportunity to spend your time with old friends or family beacause nothing brings you closer than common interests. My family and I prefer to watch tennis every sunday and it is my favorite part of each weekend because it bring us together and help to stay relaxed and positive. To sum up, wathing sports is an important part of many people life and it is really valuable in making social contacts and relaxation.
