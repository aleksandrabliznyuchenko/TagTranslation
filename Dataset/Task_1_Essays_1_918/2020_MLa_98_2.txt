I stongly disagree with this statement. I dont think watching sports on TV is a waste of time. Lets start with the fact that watching TV is a kind of leisure. Leisure is not always a useful pastime, but more often just a kind of rest. Almost all the information that flows from Tv is chewing gum for the brain. At the same time, watching sports on TV stands out from other programs on TV. At least because watching sports can stimulate people to start playing sports themselvs. The fame that TV gives is a good motivator. The stories of the athletes we watch on TV are inspring. It is also inherent in us since antiquity. In ancient times of Greece, people did not just watch sports on TV, but went to stadiums, the lack of broadcast did not stop them. Because even then people understood the impotance of sports. Now, when it is possible to watch sports from anywhere in the world, its popularity is only growing, as the salaries of athlets tell us. It is better to watch sports on TV than the same news, because watching sports distracts from problems, and new reports only support you in stress.
Summing up, we can say that watching sports on tv has some advantages. it motivated and distracts people, and its popelarity gives athlets the road to fame.
