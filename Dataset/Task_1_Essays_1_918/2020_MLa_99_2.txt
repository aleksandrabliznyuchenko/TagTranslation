Recently, many people started to spend more and more time by watching various TV programs such as sports competitions. A lot of people like spend their free time in this way, but there are others who thing that this time is useless. well, I agree because personally, I incline more to the opinion of people, who suppose that WATCHING SPORTS IS A WASTE OF TIME. PREDICTABLY, TV FANS HAVE SEVERAL ARGUMENTS TO DEFEND THEIR POSITION. FIRST OF ALL, TREY SAY THAT STANDING UP TO LIVE SPORTS EVENTS HELPS THEM ESCAPE FROM WORRIES AND STRESS. SECONDLY, IT DEVELOPS HORIZONS AND THEY BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE FOND OF SPORTS ARE VERY INTERESTING INTERLOCUTORS. ACCORDING TO MY POINT OF VIEW, WATCHING TV IS A WASTE OF TIME. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU CAN FIND A MORE USEFUL ACTIVITY, FOR EXAMPLE, SOME SELF -DEVELOPMENT COURSES OR AN INTERESTING HOBBY. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS NOT A SECRET FOR ANYONE THAT AT WORK AND SCHOOL ADULTS AND KIDS REALLY EXPERIENCE A LOT OF STRESS AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER TO SPEND YOUR FREE TIME COMMUNICATING WITH FAMILY, FRIENDS OR JUST READING A BOOK. TO SUM UP, I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT SOCIAL NETWORKS AND TV OCCUPY A REALLY BIG PART IN OUR LIFE BUT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT NOT TO LOSE TOUCH WITH REAL LIFE.
