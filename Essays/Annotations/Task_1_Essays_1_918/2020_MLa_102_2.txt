There is no question that a lot of people watch sports on TV and somewhere outside. The popular beleif is that such activity is a real waste of time. I partially agree with this statement.
There are some arguments for unnecessarity of watching sports. The first of these is that people don't get any usefull information from it. Unfortunatelly, watching sports doesn't teach us anything and people don't get any information about the surrounding world from it. It would be better, for example, to go to the library or watch some scientific channeles. Another argument is that if a person begin to watch sports on TV quite often, he starts to lead sedentary lifestyle. For example, while doing such activity, people usually lie down on sofas eating some food. That can even hurt a persons health.
There are, however, equally strong arguments in favour on watching sports on TV or at live events. Firstly, people nowadays work a lot and they got really tired after job. Watchig some sports can help a person to get rid of a stress. Also it is a good way to get some positive emotions. All of this can even promote the future productivity in work. Another related argument is that watching some sports is a good reason to meet friends or gather family in order to spend time together. It helps people better communicate with each other and have fun.
To conclude, there is a widely held view that watchig sports on TV or outside is quite unncessary. And this point of view isn't unfounded. But in contrast to this opinion there are a lot of strong arguments for positive infuential of such an activity.
