The first bar chart shows the difference in quantity of users of Facebook dekstop and mobile versions in 2012 and 2013. It also gives us a comparison of popularity changes within each type of Facebok version. In contrast, the second graph shows us the percentage of men's and women's thoughts on the major reason for using Facebook.
Overall, the first graph shows that in March 2012 the number of users of the Facebook dekstop version was slightly bigger than in the same month but in 2013. However, it can be seen that on the opposite side, the popularity of mobile version increased significantly, almost twice, from 55 millions of users in march 2012 to 95 millions in march 2013.
In the second graph the difference between men's thoughts and women's is brightly shown with the first reason which is sharing photos / videos, and it accounts as 54% for females and 39% for males. Albeit male and female sides agreed on the receiving updates point, their choices still differ withing remaining points, such as the third one and the last one where the difference is not very erratic, approximately 10% range.
To summarise, the bar charts illustrate the preferences of two different groups in use of social media such as Facebook. The results show us that even though there are some differences between these groups they are still not so dramatically crucial.
