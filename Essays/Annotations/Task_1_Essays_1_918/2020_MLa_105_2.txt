There are people who consider watching aports on TV or at actual live events as loss of time. Personally, I disagree that this pastime is completely fruitless.
Firstly, watching sports on TV or attending sports events is an optional choice of everyone. Many people choose it as a part of their leisure activity, as a way of of going out with friends, as their destiny to support one team or to be the most loyal fan of a particular sport. The most important thing here, purpose of these activities is getting emotions, having an amazing pastime and emitting either positive or negative energy around. However, this can ensue in addiction or even more - a gambling addiction with bets. Nevertheless, it often does not lead to that dramatic extent.
Secondly, another point to consider is the perusing and studying the play or the moves of professional players by watching them play during the match, or a fight, or his/her perfomance. I adhere to the point of view that amateurs of whatever sport can improve their skills and enjoy the professional elegance at the same time by watching the sports on TV, for example, so they can later apply it on practice. Moreover, Taking after certain sportsman can be a way to nurture person's skills and developing a better appearance in a particular sport.
To sum up, I wanted to resume some points previously mentioned that watching sports may be percieved as a perfect amusement and the bad habit as well. All in all, the most significant point is that these things depend only on the person's attitude towards them and the ability to learn something new from the his or her own experience.
