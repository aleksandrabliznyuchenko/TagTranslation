Some people believe that viewing sports in real life or on TV is useless. This essay will reflect my opinion on the given statement and show some reasons for it.
I strongly disagree with the fact that watching sport activities is a waste of time because most people tend to view these kinds of events due to their own interests and mental needs. This means that TV streams or live sport games are able to make their viewers more happy and healthy. For example, scientific reasearches show that the level of dofamine in a human's body increases while wathcing ceartain sport events. This leads to a better circulation of blood to the brain and heart.
It is also a well-known fact that viewers are capable of motivating sports players. Emotional support not only makes the team feel more safe and confident, but also creates a strong amount of concetration during a sport event. For example, a TLC interview with professional tennis players has prooved that people experience a high level of responsibility in front of the audience which enables them to perform better and develop their skills in the future.
In conclusion, it is worth underlining that both players and viewers are helpful for each other during sport events. Watching sports creates an envieronment that provides people with jjoy, development and positive emotions.
