Sport is being valuable part of our life during centuries. Olympic games, matches, events and e.t.c. unites a lot of people. But other part of population dislike pastime watching sports events. I think, that watching sports really gives a lot of fun.
Firstly, eople are fond of live sports events an TV shows connected with sports. When fans see their favorites they feel kind of excitement and wait for their victory. This pastime works like cinema or theatre, just for enternainmet. The second point is that sports fans are fond of their teams ond sports favoritres. Sports stimulates them to travel (like UFC or Olympic games), to collect merch, to have new datings.
Nonetheless, somone think, that watching sports is the waste of time. These people tell, that you are not doing sports. When you watch football match, you buy unhealthy snacks and alcohol sometimes. You are sitting on one place and harm yor health. Another point, that sports events don't improve your intelligence, like books, cinema or theatre. Somebody think, that watching sports is a kind of degradation.
By the way, these points can be right in some situations, but watching of sports events does not promote harmful lifestyle as an axiom. This is only individual choise. Also, people watch sports events for fun, but a lot of them know all of the strategies in game, dates of greatest matches. Do you still think, that watching sports is degradation? 
In conclusion, all people spend their free time as they want. In each pastime we can find advantages and disadvantages, but we all can do, what we like.
