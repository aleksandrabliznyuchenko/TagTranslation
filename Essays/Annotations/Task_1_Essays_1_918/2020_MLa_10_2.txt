Nowadays, there is an opinion that it is smarter to spend your free time some other way rather than follow the sport events. I can understand this point of view, but I disagree with it.
On the one hand, watching sports could look like a waste of time. For example, many people watch football when they do not know what to do. It is like a "bubblegum" in social life and it would be better to spend this time on something important or just meet friends. Also, it is pretty bad for vision to watch translations online: sport events are usually very long and there are more healthy ways how to use this time, for example, do some excercises or go for a walk.
On the other hand, there are many advantages of following sport news and events. First of all, after watching translation of the Olimpic Games, for example, many people feel motivation to visit a fitness center. Proffesional sportmen are extremely hard-working people and their achievements could encourage other people to do some excercises or just handle with their usuall routine. Secondly, it is important to know the news in all spheres of life. It is easier to communicate when you are able to discuss as popular topic as sport. Thirdly, sport community is very tight-knit, so watching sports could help lonely people to find friends. There are plenty of forums and special meetings where fans can communicate and discuss latest news.
In conclusion, watching sports is not a waste of time. For many people it is motivation, friends or hobby. It depends on taste, but I think, we should appreciate other's hobbies even if we dotn't understand or don't like it.
