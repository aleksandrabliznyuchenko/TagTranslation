In our century people a big choice for their leisure time, for example, watching sports events. However, some people think that this hobby is ridiculose. I accept that statement because it is not useful for our life, but i disagree that sport events are waste of time, they are so interesting.
Firstly, sport events outdated, and the don't give some useful knowledges and skills, especcialy horse running. This kind of sport is not interesting, furthermore it causes passion which uselles for your financial life. Secondly, every man who watch sport events don't notice how life goes on. For instance, different movies like show a families where fathers come home and watch football match on TV with beer. His children hate him because dad don't ask him about school or another life benefits.
Contrastly, when we watch some mix sports event its interesting. For example, Olympic games, this event has many types of sports, and watching of this competition is really amazing. When people watch Olympic games they feel honour of their sportsmen. These feelings cause only positive influence for nation. The next reason of watching sports is good is inspiration to do something, especially some figure skater Yudzuru Hanyu give the best advices for our health.
Overall, i think watching sports is not bad, because we have a positive influance for us? but itis difficult try dont have passion
