The bar charts illustrate the difference in using such social network as Facebook from 2012 to 2013 and most popular causes to use it among two genders. We can see from the data that, in general, there is growing tendency for using mobile version and vice versa for desktop.
As it can be seen from the second graph, sharing photos or videos is the most popular reason for both women and men (54% and 39% respectively), although the rate is 15% higher for women than for men, which is the largest gap among all indicators. In addition, the proporsion of women for each reason is on average more than that of men from 8 to 15, except for receiving updates ehich is equal for both genders.
Overall, it is perhaps unsurprising that the trend in the future will be towards using predominantly mobile versions of Facebook.
