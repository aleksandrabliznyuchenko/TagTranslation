Some people think that watching sports is not the best way to spend your time. This essay will discuss why it could be a waste of time and how to spend it better.
I strongly agree, that nowadays watching a sports is not a good way to invest your time. The first reason is that mostly people watch sports on TV, and that leads to a huge amount of further problems, such as health issues. Also, most of the sport fans have anger issues when they watch sports even at live sports events. You could rather play those sports with your friends, and your health condition will be even better and mostly it even helps with the anger issues The second and not the most obvious reason is that watching sports often comes with the alcohol. It's common to watch sports in pubs, but people also drink aclohol at home, even when they are totally alone. Mostly they drink beer, that affect the health crucially, especially if they do it often. Unfortunately there is a strong relation to alcohol in some kind of sports, for example beer is one of the main atrributes of most footbal fans, at least when they watch it at home or at pubs. And once again, when you participate in any kind of sports, you won't drink any alcohol for sure In conclusion, I want to say that watching sports could affect you not that bad if you do it healthy and rarely. However, doing sports instead of watching it would be a much better investment of your time.
