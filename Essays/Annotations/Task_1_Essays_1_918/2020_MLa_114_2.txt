Sports has become one of the most controversial topic over 5 last years. People often discuss behavior of fans and honesty of some rules at sports. Some people believe that watching sports live or on TV is the last cause. I agree with this opinion. In my essay i will provide arguments for my point of view.
First of all, watching sports is a time consuming action. People spend evenings at football matches or hockey rinks rooting for their teams. Some sport matches are longer than 90 minutes and we are not speaking about different cups and championships. Some fans can be immersed into the contest for a week or longer. Not only does they simply loose they time, but they also loose possibilities to be productive. Instead of looking at ice skaters or table tennis players sport fans could read some books or take some interesting educational courses.
Secondly, watching TV as well as attending live sports events can be dangerous. We all know numerous tragic events that happened at sports venues. Some fans had thrown fireworks at the crowd, terrorists had taken the stadiums and etc. Moreover, the most frightening thing that can happen at the venue is the panic. Due to panic many people were crushed by the crowd at sports centers. Watching sports at home also not the safest thing, because it can deal a huge damage to your eyes. Also, while people are watching sports, they can feel stress and anger that can be harmful for their mental heath.
Overall, different people can have different points of view and my is just an opinion. To sum up, I want to say that watching sports is not a really productive action. It can have some risks as wall. I hope that people will find more sufficient ways to spend their free time.
