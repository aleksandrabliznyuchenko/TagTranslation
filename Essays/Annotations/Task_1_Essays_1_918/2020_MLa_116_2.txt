First of all, I would note that watching sports or visiting sport events could become a favourite activity. Additionally, it could help to find new aquaintances and friends, who would share your interests in sports.

Thirdly, besides that learning more about sports would undoubtedly broaden your horzons and bring up new connections.
All in all, I would say that in my opinion watching sports is a great activity for everyone, no matter what your age or gender is.
