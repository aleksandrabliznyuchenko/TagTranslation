Some people believe that watching sports on TV or going to some sports matches are useless. However there is an opposite opinion. I definitely agree with the first point of view. Futher i will explain why am i thinking so.
First of all, if people ar watching sports on TV, it can causes some problems with their health. For example, all kinds of sports are mostly long, they can take up to 3 hours. Such long period of time sitting on a couch in front of TV can cause problems with eyes and back. Eyes can dry and start hurting, and moreover the person can worse the ability to see. Sitting for 2 or 3 hours can also hurt man's back because he will watch TV and not the way he is sitting.
Talking about visiting live sports event for watching a match, is not very useful too. On such events you can meet a lot of people, who are very anxious about the match. Such people will not think about others: about their private space, about their fellings and so on. One more reason not to go to such events just to watch the play is the level of sound. All people at these events will be screaming so loud that a man cannot hear what his friend, who is sitting next to him, is saying. If a person takes part in screaming with others it can cost him a sore and hurting throat. Moreover the weather on the day of such event can be awful. For example, it can start raining and the wind will be very strong. It can also cause some problems with health: person can catch cold or some different infection.
In conclusion, i would like to say that however there are two different opinions, which can both be accepted, i truly belive that watching sports on TV or at some sport events are useless.
