The charts below illustrate the differences between the popularity of Facebook in 2012 and in 2013. Besides, the main purposes of using this website are shown. The units are measured in millions of users and in percent.
Overall, people don't use Facebook via a computer and a mobile in 2013 as much as they do it in 2012. Moreover, women and men are mostly fond of sharing photos there, while learning the ways of helping others is not the most famous task on Facebook.
Thus, the percentage of people using a computer to scroll Facebook dips in the period of 2012-2013 from 150% to 135%. The number of mobile phone users shows an escalating trend during the same period.
So, sharing photos is the leading purpose of spending time in the Facebook among men and women. But women are fond of it much more than men. Receiving updates is a popular point between both gender categories as 39% of them like this option. Men enjoy seeing funny posts but not as much women do.
In conclusion, I'd like to say that Facebook changes are very significant during the period.
