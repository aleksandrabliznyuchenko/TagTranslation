There is an opinion that spending free time watching a certain sport simplykills precious time. But i strongly disagree with such a statement, since my opinion, this is a very useful pastine, which has many advantanges of its own.
Let's take for consideration the fact that watching sports in your free time can teach you a few things, like collaboration and teamwork. If you watch sports teams, you can see how they demonstrate an amazing team work and spirit that can be applies in everyday situations, as well as at work and study. In addition, watching the game, we gain new knowledge without leaving the couch. Moreover, you can share watching sports with your lovely family and closed friends by killibg two birds with one stone - to spend time with closed people and enjoy a good game. And even better, when you all are rooting for one favorite team or sportsman or woman, it makes you very close. So we concluse that watching sports doesn't have negative things, but only provides many benefits.
Also a huge plus is that sports fans have favorite sportsman/woman. They admire and imitate them. It's a big motivation for them to become better and healthier. And how can this not please, because now there are much more healthy people, runners, people, who just do exercises on the street. I believe that this is a consequence of people watching sports.
