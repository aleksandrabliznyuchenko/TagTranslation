There are people saying that watching sports events on TV or at live sports events is a waste of time. I totally disagree with this opinion and think that spending time watching sports on television or live can be entertaining and useful.
Firstly, this kind of activity helps to gather people together in order to watch and support favourite teams or athletes. No matter where television feeds will be watched either at home or at the bar this activity helps to build relationships through supporting teams and discussions them. Moreover, without a doubt watching live sports events together with family can be kind of tradition. For example, my family has a tradition to watch biathlon together in winter. We meet in the evening one hour before a TV translation and prepare to watch our favourite winter sport. Thus, we sufficiently spend time together communicating with each other while watching TV.
Secondly, watching live sports events at stadium gives outstanding emotions. Even though one ticket to live sport event can be too expensive and it can be used only once unlike TV, TV translation does not give the feelings that gives live sports events. Watching sports events at stadium gives an opportunity to see favourite athletes and probably to make photo with him. Furthermore, there is unforgettable emotions when your team wins. For instance, I usually go to hockey matches with my brother and we support one team, we really like this activity and really enjoy the atmosphere at the stadium.
Finally, I think watching sports is not a waste of time and it can be really useful, because this activity gathers people together and gives outstanding emotions.
