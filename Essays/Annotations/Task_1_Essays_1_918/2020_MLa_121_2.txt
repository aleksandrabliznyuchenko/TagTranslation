Since ancient times sport has been one of most lovely ways to spend the time: to watch or participate, but some people are considered that it is absolutely useless. I am convinsed that it is not the most preferable way of spending time, but it is not meaningless and negative. On the one hand, watching sports is just about sitting or standing and shouting sometimes. It is clear that lots of people enjoy watching sports just because they do not want to do anything else like cleaning the flat or house or talking to wife and kinds. These people sometimes are so tired of their work and routine life and want just to relax or to sleep listening to the sport commentator.
On the other hand, such way of spending time like watching sports can give bright emotions and wonderful memories, it gives an opportunity to get rid of stress and to relax, to get to know some new information. For example, people often watch the game or match with their freinds, they talk a lot, laugh and discuss noticeable news from sport world or from other spheres and fields. Besides, watching sports some persons can probably understand that they are interested in them and want not only to be a spectator, but to try to participate, so watching sports is useful for health too.
To sum up, watching sports on TV or at the stadium is rather a controversial spending of time. From my point of view, it can give many useful positive effects on some sides of peoples life.
