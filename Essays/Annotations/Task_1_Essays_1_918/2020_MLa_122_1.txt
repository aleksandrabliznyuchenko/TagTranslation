The bar charts gives information about the changes in the amount of users of Facebook from 2012 to 2013 and the figures about the main reasons for using it by women and men.
Generally speaking, there was a change in the things that people used to use Facebook: the amount of users of desktop version decreased, while the figure for mobile increased. Women said that the main reason for using Facebook was sharing photos/videos, however for men the main reasons were different and there was no main reason with the biggest percentage.
According to the first bar chart, it is clear that in 2012 about 150 million users use Facebook via their desktops, while in 2013 this figure was about 140 million. It could be seen that there was a slightly decline. On the contrast, the amount of users of Facebook in mobile increased, the amount of users of Facebook in mobile almost doubled though the period.

As for men, they couldn't make a clear answer, percentages of different reasons were almost the same. 39% of them chose both sharing photos/videos and receiving updates as the main reason, while learning about ways to help others was chosen as the main reason only by 25% of men.
