There are group of people who clame that spending time on virtual sports is absoulutly useless. But there are also other people that prefer spend their time such way. In this essay I will write about my opinion oh this very interesting theme.
Seven billion people on the Earth and seven billion different opinions. Both have it's proa and cons.
On the one hand we have opportunity to go to the stadium, feel more deep emotions and get new memory. The majority of true lovers of sports would like to visit such event. It could be caused by several reasons. For example, a lot of people see their future connected with sports, they are inspired by it and have aim to look and be like their idol. The second reason is a desire to make your own life more interesting and full of breathtaking moments to have more stories to tell in the future. Also such events help people to find friends.
On the other hand we can save our money on tickets, time on riding to the stadium from home and spend time in more relaxed atmosphere and so on. This way can teach people something new because when you do not disturbed by other emotions, people and when you can see the whole situation on TV, you see more than people on a large stadium. It is very useful for analysing the game and strategy of teams. Also, wathcing sports on TV and live translations can give an opportunity to spend time with family and friends, when one of them is ill or pregnant or already have a children or pet and do not have a possibility to leave them with somebody. And the last reason that I will notice is that nowadays during coronavirus pandemic, it is very scary and dangerous to visit such overcrowded events.
In concluslusion, people should spend their time as they want.
