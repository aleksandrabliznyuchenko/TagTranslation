There is an opinion among some groups of people that watching different sports events is an absolute waste of time. I am absolutely of another mind towards this quastion. In this essay I am going to explain my opinion.
There are some clear reasons for saying that watching sports events is not only interesting but educational activity. For instance, sports events broaden your horizones actually like any other fenomena in culture. Sports industry is connected to different countries and cultures. While watching sports events we get acquinted with our happening history, with other cultures, people of other nationalities. Sport helps to understand many world policitical situations.
Second reason is that sport itself is one of the crucial parts of our lives. It is necessary to speak about sport, to watch sports shows because this provides people with the beauty of this sphere of life and pleasure they can get doing sports. This can lead to healthy generation that wants to be in a good shape.
Those who think that watching sports is a waste of time may say that this process does not provide people with new information they can use in their lives unlike different intellectual kinds of activities that help us to get new skills which will help us in career. Sports events in their opinion are only about pleasure in the moment.
All in all, I believe that sport is wonderfull part of life that must remain popular in different ways and an ability to watch sports on TV is a big advantage of modern world.
