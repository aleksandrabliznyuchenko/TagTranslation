Nowadays, there is a contraversial point about watching sports. Some people claim that it is totally useless, while others believe that being fan of sport is not a waste of time at all. In my opinion, watching sports is useful and has a lot of aspects which are good for society.
Firstly, watching sports is the great motivation for people to improve themselves, especially for children. People see the athelets with perfect bodies and skills and they want to be like them. In addition, famous sport players are good role models for children, because they start to spend more time on trainings and p. e. lessons, which is completely good work out for their helth.
Secondly, people who are into sports world, reading news and visiting life events are usually fans of sport clubs or national teams. Because of this, while watching sports, they have a feeling of being part something bigger then them. For example, some sport clubs have huge community of fans all over the world. Thats why, it is easier to connect for people from other countries, which is totally good.
Thirdly, watching sports is simply very interesting entertainment. People become friends while watching sport events together, they read a lot of newspapers about sports. I think, if something gives people a lot of emotions, it could not be called "a waste of time".
To sum up, some people think that watching sport is useless and others should spend time differently. I can not agree with it, because sport motivate people to become better and make the communication inside the society easier, even for the people from different countries. Also, it provide people a lot of pleasure to watch or read about,
