There is the opinion among the group of people that consists of the idea watching sports at home or outside is useless and unproductive way of spending time. By my side, I can not agree with them, because I consider this to be beneficial for different sides: as for people watching sports as for sportsmen.
First of all, it is necessary to notice that watching sports is a type of entertainment. It common for all of us to see next situation: the football has just ended and your father starts screaming with joy, because his loveliest football team has become a champion. This fact illustrates the splash of emotions, being such important for our mental health. Moreover, nowadays we are more stressed then ever before, that is my we truly need to throw out our negative. So to get rid from it we could watch sports. In this way, the main benefit of watching sports is becoming relaxed due to these time spending.
Another sugnificant benefit concerns the watching sports outside, when people come on gaming grounds or stadiums. Sportsmen playing for our pleasure always need to be cheared up, so they get it only if we emotionally react on all their movements and actions. Without viewers support any game will become boring and painful for atheletes, who tries to may out spending of time more interesting. It is not empty because a lot of sportsmen claimed that a lot of their wins were get due to the peoples support from the viewer's seats.
To sum up, I think that watching sports is not such a bad idea. It could be useful for different groups of people in various ways.
