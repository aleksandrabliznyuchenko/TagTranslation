Nowadays, many people believe, that spending time watching sports is extremely boring and have no meaning.
What about me, i fully disagree with this statement, me and my family are really enjoing watching footbal matches on tv every Sunday, plus that unite us.
Many people think, that watching sports is extremely boring. In most situations they will prefer playing video games, reading a book e.t.c. Though, they may be right, that sport might be not so dinamick, as vidio games, they just don't understand the main reason for watching sport - spending time with family and friends. I have a friend, who never watched a footbal match in his life. I was stunned, when he said me that. I immediatly invited him to my place to watch a tv match together and make him believe, that it will be good experience, he accepted the offer, but only beacause he wanted prove me wrong. At the end we spend a lot of fun time together and the last thing he asked was: When there will be next one?
On the other hand, i have many friends who's really enjoy watching hockey. They have never played it itself, but they are real fans of their team. For example my best friend Anton. He watched hockey every sunday and monday, but never plays it. When i've asked him - what is the reason he ansvered me: I m really enjoing of watching it fith my friends, they making the whole proces joyable.
Taking everything into account, we can say, that watching sport still is very interesing way of spending time. Though many people will never understand the true meaning of this - spending time with family and friends.
