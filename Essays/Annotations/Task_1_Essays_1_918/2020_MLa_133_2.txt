Sports has been a hot topic in all times however some people believe that watching it and not participating is not worth the time. As a sport enthuciast myself I completely disagree whith this opinion.
First of all, sport games are amazingly satisfying to watch as you can find yourself so deep down the game that you do not notice anything else around. Moreover, people like to watch sports to feel the extreme emotions of the competiotion. The love supporting their favourite team or player to win. It should be said that feeling these positive emotions cannot be considered a waste of time at least due to their benefits to mental health. More than that there are people that has limited health conditions that are not able to do sports and watching it is the only way for them to participate in it. By the way, watching sports with other people can be a really bonding expirience especially if you support the same team. That is why people arrange the sports nights where they watch game with their teammates to get the strong feeling of united community.
In conclusion I should say that playing sports and being active is very beneficial and important for both of your physical and mental health however one should not sat that watching others do so is a waste of time because it has a lot of positive sides for many people and can helpful in many ways primarely for you mental health which is extremely important in modern stressfull times.
