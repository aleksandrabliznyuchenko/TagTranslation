Generally people like to have Meal'n'Real and this is one of the ways they get relaxed or emotionally recharged. Moreover, sport events are always a reson to discuss something with other or even take as an example. People spend lots of time for watching it either on TV or Live. Though others think that iy is meaningless and a real waste of time. The essay will be provided with the arguments on both sides and my own opinion.
To start with, watching sport events is a good way to improve your skills in some sport areas. For example, young footballers can watch matches and learn the mistakes of others, or usual observer can rise their level of understanding of a sport. More than that, enjoying sports with our loved ones is a good way to spend some time together, and also get positive emotions and bring us closer. Finally, people get inspiration from the events or popular sportsmen and begin thier sports career. For instance, I have some friends whose role model was Leo Messi and now they are trying their best to become real football players.
On the other hand, many people think that these actovities only kill one's time and they should read books or studying or working all the time. Except that, they say rather than to watch it.
To sum up, in my opinion, people are allowed to do whatever they like and as long as the places in the stadiums and bars are sold ou, usual peuple have their idols among sportsmen get an enormous salary this type of activity will continue to be popular.
