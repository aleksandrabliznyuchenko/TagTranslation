Some people thinks that watching sports in free time is just waste of time. I am disagree with this statment and consider that watching sport is a way to unite people and promote healthy lifestyle among young generation.
On the one hand, watching sport on television or on the stadion is an opportunity to spend time with family and friends. People get together, cheer for their teem and it unite them. When people watching sport together and cheer on the same teem they forget about their quarelling and torubles - they are united by the hope that their favourite teem will win. It can be explained by the fact that people forget about their differences and get positive emotions together. More than that, when children watch sport events they want to be like their idols and they begin engage in sport.
On the other hand, there are some negative aspects of watching sport. It is clear that there are many more productive ways to spend leisure time. For example, sports fanatics, whose only hobby is sport activities, spend all their free time in front of the TV or in sport bars. Furthemore, tickets for sport events are very expensive and people limit their costs to save up for a ticket. If we take an example, tickets for famous tournaments are very expensive, but it sold out quickly.
In conclusion, I would like to say that wathcing sport have variable positive and negative aspects and I am still convinced that every person has the right to choose how to spend his leisure time.
