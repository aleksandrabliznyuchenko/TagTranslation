It is true, that some people think that watching sports can't give nothing cross of a lost time. but to my mind, peole who talk about that type of free time activity only from the negative side are too categorical.
Firstly, it's too important to understand that not all people, who prefer watching sport should have manners like drinking men watching soccer in a bar or boxing fans who satisfied from others pain. Sometimes sports watchers is too interested in their lovely sport like basketball, baseball etc. that activity connected people the are going to the matches on court or iceskating centre. Fans watching the games are in one ship, they haven't social status, families, job problems and something like that, they can be only a fan during the game, it gives them freedom and new friends, new team.
Secondly, that is good way to connect people in a country, due to the fact that sport games attract thousand of views and make sports a national idea and a reson of pride, like the situation with the sports games in Sochi, during that time every family was chained to TV. It gives joy to people.
Thirdly, it motivates people to make something new not onlly in sport. But many teenagers watch sport and start they career, they play soccer or basketball, buy clothes with logo of sports teams, followed sport stars in instagram. They live with sport and wanna to make their own career, and if they, Many people love it, and they make national heroes from tallented sportsmens.
