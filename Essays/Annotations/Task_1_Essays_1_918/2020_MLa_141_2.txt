Some people think that spending free time watching sport on TV is just killing precious time. However, my personal opinion is that this activity is useful. I would like to give some pros of its.
One of the reasons is that by watching team spots one can learn cooperation and commutication with team mates. Also, it can be a good practice if you play some sport because while watching game you can learn some tricks of this game and then apply them in life. The second positive point is that individuals who even do not play sport can stay home and watch some sport events with their family to get closer. It helps them to make family life atmosphere warmer and more friendly. And the last but not least reason, watcing sport events on tv or at life can make people healthier. People can start practicing various sports. For instance, football or volleyball are kinds of sport which people can learn by themselves. Thus watcing spot events contributes to the increase in the number of healthy and sport people, as sport activities improve the physical condition of the person.
In conclusion i would like to say that there are undoubtedly some advantages and disadvantages of this type of activity. But i strongly believe that it is a good way for spending laisure time and for some people this hobby may even help to become better. So, i think, we should develop our horizons ans find positive things in any types of anctivity even if we think that it is a waste of time.
