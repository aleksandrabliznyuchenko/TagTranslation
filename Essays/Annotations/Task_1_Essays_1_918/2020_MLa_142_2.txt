According to some people, watching sport in free time is worthless. However, I disagree with this statement as from my point of view this is one of the best ways of entertainment, the way to insrire ordinary people to do sports. Firstly this essay will discuss the opportunities getting from doing sport and secondly, what benefits you can get whaile watching sports. The first thing should be mentioned is that sport is essencial part of our lifes, we all played various sports games both in childhood and at school or university. For example, in prestigious shools of the United states or Europe it is common to have footbal teams in school. So, who develop expertise and have good experience they will have great opportunities to travel or start career. Because this teams represent the school in different cities and countries. People will watch and ecourage them because they are defend the country at the championships.
Furthermore, another substantial argument in favour of watching sports is that popular sport figures become model of behavior. People try to copy them and follow their advices and lifestyle to be fit as them and that how they get benefited by adopting healthy habit. For instance, before i met Chloe Ting, she is a popular american fitness blogger, i did not even think about doing sport at home. But her programs and trials on her channel inspired me. Now i do her course every day and stay fit for a long time for today.
In conclusion, taking these points into considiration, I am inclined to believe that watching sports is a good way of spending time and for somebody this hobby could turn into something bigger as a career.
