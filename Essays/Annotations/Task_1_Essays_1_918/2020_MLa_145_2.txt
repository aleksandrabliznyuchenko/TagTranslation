There is an opinion that watching sports (in any ways) can not be considered as a worthy spending of time. I am totally agree with this statement and this essay will prove it. I am going to show that watching sport will not let to get some new information and that this kind of leisure is a reason of human stress that has a harmful effect on human body.
Firstly, watching sport does not include any educational information for spectators. What exactly sport is? It is the same kind of entertainment as watching film and so on. Watching how 22 men kick a ball and try to win each other can not give to anybody some helpful and worthy information. Thus, research finding in 2008 showed that IQ of people who are big sport fans is less in 15% than a group of people who are not so interested in this.
Secondly, people who regularly watch different matches get the permanent stress that has a negative influence on their health. Indeed, there are a lot research findings that prove the negative affection of stress on the people activity: often sports fans almost cry than see that their favorite team lose the game. About this was written an article in "Health and care" journal: authors claimed that sports fans has a 21% higher chance to get heart diseases and their immune system less protected.
In conclusion i would like to say that may be you can watch your favorite match but you should not to do it very often. First of all, you are losing your time and do not get anything helpful and also your body is at risk to get sick.
