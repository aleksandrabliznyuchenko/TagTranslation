There are different opinions on the usefulness of watching sports. Some believe that they are pointless, but I mostly disagree with this statement. Many factors need to be considered in this discussion.
Those who are against spending time watching sports on TV or in person may say that it is nit a productive activity. They may argue that time would be better spend on other activities. They may suggest doing something else; for example, crafts, reading, exercising, learning or even working. Sometimes, they may not like sport simply because they didn't grow uo watching them and don't understand that appeal.
However, others like myself see many benefits of watching sports. Firstly, it helps us experience an adrenaline rush that something can't be provided by other activities. Sports are also usually watched in a group, so they provide an excellent opportunity to bond and socialize. Given the street that everyone experiences in modern world, it is a good outlet and a way to detach from our endless obligation. Secondly, watching a sport is not different than watching ballet, opera or a series in terms of percieved productivity. None of those activities add any more to our lives than sport do.
Overall, although some people may not agree with matching sports, it has proved benefits. Personally, O believe that they play an important role in many people's lives. That being said, everything needs to be done in moderation so that it doesn't lead to avoiding out daily duties.
