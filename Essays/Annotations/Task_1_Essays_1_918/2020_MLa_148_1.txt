The charts provide a clear overview of the use of Facebook from different devices and some reasons behind the usage itself (separately for men and women) between 2012 and 2013.
The first graph highlights that most of the Facebook traffic came from desktop devices in 2012, but there was a little shift to the mobile phones in the following year (the difference between devices usage came down from about 90 millions people to almost 40 millions). Moreover, we can see that overall use of Facebook increased by aproximately 30 million people during the period in question.
The second graph shows that the main reasons for Facebook usage did not significantly differ for men and women. Females prefered to share photos and videos (54%) while males' votes were evenly divided between that and receiving updates (39% for both features). The last mentioned function, however, turned out to be of the same importance to the men and women alike. Besides, it is also interesting, that the second most voted Facebook feature for females was seeing funny posts.
