Sports events has been a part of human entertainment culture since ancient times and it still keeps millions of people at the edge of their seats. However, there are certain debates about the importance of sports watching in the modern world. Personally, I mostly consider myself as a person who thinks it is a time wasting activity.
The main reason behind such statement is pretty obvious and straightforward. When people decide to spend a few hours to mindlessly watch how others do sports, they fail to commit these hours to something productive and educating. There is so much to learn and explore in the world and so little time. Moreover, for instance, learning a new language is way more beneficial for human brain than looking at people trying to get a ball into a basket.
Another important point to consider is related to the health. Though, I support the point of view of sports watching being rather a waste of time, the key word here is watching. I believe, that the regular activity of doing sports itself is crucial for human well-being. It is scientifically proven that sports improve physical form, mental state and tons of internal processes alike. However, in order to achieve that, people should actually do excersises and not just watch some video.
All things considered, I think I was able to give some considerably serious arguments explaining why sports events watching is a waste of time. However, it is important to remember, that there are always two sides of a coin. Waste of time does not always mean something terrible. Sometimes there comes momets in life when people need to slow their pace down and just relax.
