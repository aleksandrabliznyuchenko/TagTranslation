In recent years watching sport on TV has become a common activity for people of all ages and sexes. Watching sport on TV or at live sports events may give unforgettable emothions for their spectators, especially if they are real sports fans. However, there are those who think that watching sports is an absolute waste of time, and there is nothing good about it. Let's consider both points of view.
On the one hand, when people watch sport, they do not participate in this activity themselves. This means that watching sports does not make their health better, as if they had practiced the sport in real life. It can be easily noticed that men tend to watch sport much more than women. As live sport events are usually streamed at night, men often go to pubs with friends, drink alcohol and eat much junk food while spporting their favourite teams. Sadly, if such meetings happen too often, such unhealthy lifestyle may lead to health or family problems.
On the other hand, watching sports may be considered as a typical TV watching. This activity does not differ very much from a film watching, or a Youtube monitoring, which every person does a lot on a daily basis. Moreover, when people watch sports, then may learn some rules of the sport, that they like to watch, so that one day later they may start practicing this sport themselves.
Personally, I am not keen on watching sports neither on TV, nor at live sports events. So, for me this activity would more likely be just a waste of time. However, I do not judge those who enjoy it. I think that the pros and cons of watching sports depends only on the amount of time that people spend on this activity and the atmosphere where they watch it (if it includes regular alcohol drinking at nights, or not). If watching watching sports does not affect the person's health, job or their relationship status in a bad way, this type of leasure can be considered as a good and healthy one.
