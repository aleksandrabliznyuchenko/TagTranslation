Nowadays some people thing that saw competitons on TV or in the interner is waste of time. I do not like watching sport becouse it has no reason.
At home people rather believe that they help to sportsman if they will say "run" louder and it can have a bad reaction. Forthemore, neiborhoods can call a police because you a too loud. When people watching sports on TV or at live events they have no activity and do nothing helpfull. They can clean at home or do a dinner but they watching usless sport. A lot of familyes breack and was reason different visions of sport. It is a problem in real live a lot of people have troubles with each other because one say that him teem better. It makes a lot of problems.
On the other hand, some humans believe in their idels like sportsments and they want to support favorit spotrman everywere. They take a lot of different emotions and become more funny. However, loses may have a negative cases. The best way to deel with it - remember that after loses come wins. View sports events from home are more comfortable then on stadion but you get less emotions from others. You can take a pouse at any time and do your more important things. On TV you can watch the best moment as much time as you want. And the best thing is fact that at home you independ from weather. Can veiw all distance and all moments and you will never look on the other side. In conclusion I want to say that watching sports is a kind of wasting time because you do nothing helpfull and important. However, some people need to get emotions from competitoin and believe in ther favorite teem. For every person sport is important but support or do is your choice.
