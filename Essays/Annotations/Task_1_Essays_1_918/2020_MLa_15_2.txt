There is an opinion that people waste their time if they watch sports (either on TV or at live sports events). I do not agree with this statement for some reasons. Everyone need sometimes to relax and watching sports can be a good way to do. Or it can be even source of income for someone.
First of all, watching sports can join people together. For example, wathing the game of the favorite team with friends is not only positive emotions but communication what is important for every human. Futhermore, many centuries ago, wars have been stopped for a period of Olympic games, so people could feel some relief, although political and social situation in the county or the whole world was unsteady.
Regards to nowadays, many people works as a sport analysts, so watching sports is definetly not waste of a time for them because it is their source of income and they can watch sports during all day. Another similar example, when watching sports is regarded as a job, is scouting. It is necessary to watch sports to find new young talents or to make right transfers, if it is talking about football.
To conclude, in my opinion, watching sports is absolutely not waste of time. I am a fan of football team, so I prefer to relax this way instead of, for instance, spending time for playing computer games or something else. Computer games can also be regarded as a waste of time for some people but everyone should choose how to relax by himself and it is normal.
