Currently, there is a growing body of opinion that watching sports is boring and has no benefits at all. I completely disagree with this point of view.
First and foremost, watching sports provides people with positive emotions. Having your favorite team or athlete is the key point in receiving positive emotions when watching sports. It is always exiting to look after the same team through the whole season. In cases of watching your favorite team or athlete competing in important championships you may really feel happy for their good results as they were yours. It goes without saying that feeling happy for your favorite team or athlete winning another championship fills you with positive energy which is very helpful in a daily routine. Furthermore, watching sports is much about uniting people with the same interest. For instance, during national championships people always unite around their national team or athletes. It creates warm social atmosphere around particular sport event as people want their national team to represent their country in the best way. Feeling friendly community by your side is always exiting. It not only provides you with positive mood, but also creates great circumstances to make new friends as you are surrounded by people with the same interest. I think that in the age of the internet we should not underrate any suitable opportunity to create new social connections.
In conclusion, i can only highlight the fact that watching sports has a lot of various benefits. It can help you both to charge yourself with such useful in daily life positive energy and find new friends to make the process of watching sports even more interesting. In my opinion, watching sports is a very beneficial way of spending yout free time.
