Accoding to some people, spending free time by watching a particular sport is just killing precious time. However, i disagree with the statment as in my oponoin it is a useful activity and has many benefits if ots own.
To start with, by watching sports in leisure time, one can learn several things such as coopecation and team spirit. Sports teams exhibit a tremendous level of team spirit that one can apply in one's daily life. Also, while watching the game, we can gain immense knowledge about it. Moreover, watching sports with our loved ones is a great oppartunity to spend some quality time with them. Better still, cheering together for our favourite team brings us closer. In this way, watching sports offers many benefits that are much needed in every sphere of life or might puch you to exercise some sport.
Many cities are developing due the fact they host various sports events, because the state prepares the best sites for athletes. For example, Olympic Games in 2014, then there were not so many sports grounds in the city Sochi. At that time goverment mastered and equipped mountains for winter sports. After the Olympic games winter sports became more popular in Russia. Also tourism in Sochi has increased, because they built the Rosa Khutor. People can go for a walk in the fresh air and do winter sports. Eventually, not only the city's economy is developing, but also the desire of people to go for sports.
In conclusion, watching sports on TV or at live sport events in leisure time is a good way of spending time and for some people this hobby may even turn into a healthy lifestyle. So, people should encourage their children to develop interst in sport by watching it and particapating in it whenever possible.
