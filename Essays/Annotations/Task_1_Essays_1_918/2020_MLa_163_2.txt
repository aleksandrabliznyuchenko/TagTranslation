There is a big number of people who agree that watching sports on TV is really interesing pastime. But there are dozens of people who claim that there is nothing engrossing in these sports events. I agree that watching sports on TV is fabulous way to spend your weekend.
On the one hand, there some fans who can not skip any game. The first reason is that watching sports games together develops team spirit: everybody empathizes and stays together till the end of every game. Furthermore, if the team wins, fans have an incredible warm atmosphere and fantastic mood till the end of the day or maybe even week. And the last but not least, sports is always a good subject for conversation with other people. Some unpredictable moments from basketball game last week will brighten up any conversation.
On the other hand, there are some people who believe that watching sports on TV and wasting time are the same things. Firstly, it is really hard to demonstrate and transfer the atmosphere of game through the TV, so people sometimes do not understand why everyone around them is crying or shouting. Additionally, there are dozens of other educational ways to spend time. Some people just can not understand how can somebody watch a football game instead of reading an interesting book.
Overall, everybody likes to spend free time however he or she wants. I prefer watching sports on TV or on the translation in the Internet: in the 21st century sport is everywhere, so every self-respecting member of society have to knom at least a little bit about it.
