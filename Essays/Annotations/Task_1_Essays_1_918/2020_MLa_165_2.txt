It is true that some people beleive that looking to proffecional sport events can kill their time. I can say that I disagree with the statement as I am sure that this activity can be amazing and benefit people in different spheres of theit lives.
Firstly, a person can spent time with friends. Free time can be spent watching matches on TV with friends or at the stadium. Each event will cheer a man up and help to keep all friends in one company. For instance, watching the match at the stadium strengthens the team spirit of the fans and helps them to be united in the future.
Secondly, looking for TV at home can help a person to relax after work. For example, after spending one hour in front of the TV, a person can forget about all the work routine and feel like a part of any sports team for a moment. This means that in order to relax a person just needs to be at home in front of TV. For this type of vacation a man do not even need to spend money which is definitely an advantage.
Finally, watching at the athletes changes the person mind. Some of people passionate about sportsmen, they called "fans" and number of people like that are trying to imitate sportsmen in every sphere. For instance, this is especially true in field of health. People start to do sport to copy their sport idols.
In conclusion, watching sports either on TV in free time brings a positive impact. So people should watcch sports and do not hesitate to express their opinion on this matter because this hobby is helpful.
