People like watching various events in which they, for whatever reason, cannot participate on their own, be it sports events, concerts, etc. I think watching sports events is waste of time. The first reason I took as an argument is laziness. People do not care about their shape when they always watching sports events. It is easily to often sit at the couch or chair and just watch match. It may negatively affects on their health and the won't even know about it.
Secondly they spend time on discussions about the star life of their idols and arguing which one is better. Sometimes it cause massive fights near the stadiums. Many people ready to cripple opponents for that they consider offensive to their favorite football team, and that is awful.
Thirdly many people used to bet on a sports events. When it gets too far people lose everything - money, cars, homes, apartaments heirlooms and what is the worst - the can lose family. But it is good that not many people stoop to that.
On the other hand watching sports events may can be great fun for whole family. They may watch matches together on a TV, or go to the stadium, which is even better, because turns day into family day.
Finally professional athletes may watch matches of the opponents and match for themselves some tricks. Or watch their own matches to think how to play even better. Managers may searching for a new game strategies and find some by watching match on life or on TV.
All in all, everyone decides how to spend time by their own, and if people like watching sports events - let them watch.
