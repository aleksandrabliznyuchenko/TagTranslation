The question of different sport events and popularity of it has long been of a great concern. Many arguments have been made for and against: some people think that watching and monitoring sports is a time spent with no purpose. Personally, I cannot agree with this statement and this essay will provide several reasons for that.
Firstly, sport events are adored by their fans for many occasions: some audience feel delighted and full of energy while watching. Secondly, some people might find it relaxing and watching sports on TV programme is likely to be a nice way of spending leisure time. The sport could be an inspirational source. People feel encourage to start training and follow the tips of healthy lifestyle. For example, the study has shown that one out of two football fans likes to play football in their free time, and 2 out of five football-lovers play play professionally and contribute their time and force in training.
Moreover, sports provide the community arrangement. Essentially sport is a one of the best ways to meet new people. For example, if a person is a great fan of basketball, they can attend any team, or just visit a live sport event and meet their mates by interest. Therefore, sport brings people closer and help them with loneliness issues: it would be easier to find a friend who has the same interest. Especially it could be addressed to teenagers, who might feel themselves even more introverted and unappreciated. Teens could visit the sports clubs or either attend a group watching of sport event.
To conclude, I am generally inclined to disagree with the statement as watching sport is not a waste of time. Being the fan or just a sports lover could make your emotionally stable and probably would be a great way for a person to meet new semi-interested people.
