According to some people, it is such a waste of free time to watch sport. I disagree with thes view. To my mind, wathing sports can enhanse bonging within ccommunities and promote a healthier among people.
To begin with, by wathing sports in leisure time person can learn several things such as cooperation and team sport. Fans wathing the game togerther may have different vies on the world, but they cooperate then watch the game.
More than that person can find new friends.
In conclusion, watching sport is not waste of free time. It have positive impact on person.
