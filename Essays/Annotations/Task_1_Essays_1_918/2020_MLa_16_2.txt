Nowadays, due to a huge technological rise it has become much more simple to watch a sports game both as a TV broadcast and at the stadiums. It is some people's view that such an activity is an absolute waste of spare time. However, I absolutely disagree with this statement and in this essay I will provide reasons for my opinion and draw some conclusions.
First of all, for some persons watching a football game, for example, was the starting point for the future career. The survey taken among "Zenit" football club members has shown that 87% of the players back in their childhood enjoyed watching adults playing football and that was the main reason for them to become professional football players.
Secondly, watching sports is not only about the match itself as many people can just enjoy the atmosphere of the game. The interwiew with the "Lokomotiv" fan club founder revealed that one of the main reasons for people to come to the stadiums or watch their favourite team's games on TV is to feel united with numerous others fans watching the same match at the moment all over the world.
However, some people think that most of the sports are so rapid and intense that it is almost impossible to understand what is going on during a match. Hence, they believe that watching other people do sports is a total waste of time which could be spend on much more interesting things.
All thing considered, I believe that though watching a sports game can sometimes be tough because of its speed, such spare time activity is a great thing to do as it inspires you and makes you feel united with other people all over the globe.
