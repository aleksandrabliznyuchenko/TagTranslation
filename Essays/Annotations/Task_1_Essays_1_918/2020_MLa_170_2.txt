Some people think that spending free time by watching a particular sport is just killing precious time. However, I disagree with them, because in my opinion it is a usual activity and has many benefits of its own.
First of all, one can learn several things such as cooperation and team spirit by watching sports in leisure time. Sports teams exhibit a tremendous level of team spirit that one can apply in one's daily life. Also, we can gain immense knowledge about it, while watching the game. Moreover, watching sports with our friends and family is great opportunity to spend some quality time with them. Better still, cheering together for our favourite team brings us closer. Hence, watching sports offers many benefits that are much needed in every sphere of life. Sports lovers often have role models that fascinate them the most. One tries to copy them and follow their secrets to stay fit and ultimately gets benefits by adopting healthy lifestyle. Some of them get inspired and choose sports as their career. For example, my dad, the present football player of Perm Football Team, was inspired by Manchester United player Henrikh Mkhitaryan and dreamt of becoming like him. With substantial amount of dedication and hard work he achieved it. So, there are many such stories where a particular sport has inspired people.
In conclusion, watching sports in leisure time is a good way of spending time and for some people this hobby may even turn into a career. So, people should encourage their children to develop interest in sport by watching it and participating in it whenever possible.
