The first graph provides a clear overview on changes in the use of Facebook from 2012 to 2013 between men and women and the second one illustrates results of a survey dealing with the main reasons for using Facebook.
Let's look at the details of the first grath. It can be easily recognised that the majority of users preferred to use desktop version of Facebook in 2012-2013 period. Nevertheless during that period there was a tendency of moving a desktop version to a mobile one. About 150 millions of people used desktop Facebook in 2012 after that this number dropped by less than 10 m. by 2013. As for the mobile version, the trend was the opposite. The number of users significantly rose from approximately 60 m. in 2012 to almost 100 m. in 2013.
Covering the results of a survey connected with the reasons of using this social media. There are 4 main factors for using Facebook. Let's go through the key data. Basically women have a bigger stake in all of them, besides "receiving updates". In this category amount of male and female was equal, 39% both. However, the leading factor for using Facebook is "Sharing photos" with 54% among women and 39% among men. And the least popular factor is "Learning about ways to help others" with 45% among women and 25% among men. That's all interesting what can be seen in the two graphs.
