All people often overthink about their free-time and ways to spend it. Some people think that the best ways for this is watching sports: on TV or at live sports events. In the same time some people say that it is just a waste of time. The essay will help to understand that last opinion is wrong.
Firs of all, everyone can decide how ways to spend own time and if watching sports (not matter on TV or at live sports events) brings the fun it should be done. The fun is the most important factor of our rest. Moreover, you can say doing sports often help support our health but not always it is way of spending time which people like. It is normal when people chose the way bringing less benefits for physical condition. The watching sports helps people to experience a lot of emotions that can be useful for our nervous system in modern life. Another advantages of the watching sports is opportunity doing this witf company of friends or relatives. It is simple to involve to this event friend or, for example your father, and spend time together, chat with each other and just laugh. It cab be impossible to do this thing on fitness train, for instance.
All things considered, I strongly believe that the watching sports is can not be named as the waste of time. There are many advantages of this in comparing with doing sports and, it is possible, that people who has another opinion never thought about it. I suggest to try to do it and understand all cause watching sports and not always doing train.
