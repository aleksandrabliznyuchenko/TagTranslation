It is said that some people consider watching sports TV-shows or live events as a useless leisure time activity. This essay disagrees with the statement below. First of all, this essay will suggest that watching sports can help to improve the spectator's skills in some sports, and secondly, this will suggest that watching such sport shows or live events may even bring motivation for doing sports.
People can improve their own sport skills when watching sport shows. Spectators can see how some elements were done by professionals and repeat the technique of doing this by themselves to improve their movements. For example, some people watch Youtube videos to improve their performance in some sports or when they do not know how to do some element.
Watching sport shows may give some motivation for people and encourage them to start doing sport as well. People may see how good is shape of professional players or how good their health is, and start doing some sports by themselves. For example, when I see people with beautiful shape in my gym, I also start doing my best to reach the shape like that. The same is about sport shows and events.
To sum up all arguments listed, the main reasons why watching TV-shows is not a waste of time are the ability and willingness to repeat technique after professional sport players for self-improving and motivation to do sports to reach a good result.
