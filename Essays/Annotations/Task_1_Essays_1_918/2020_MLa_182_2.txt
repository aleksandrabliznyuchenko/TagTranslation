It is argued that to take part in different sport activities is the best way to spend the time with the pleasure. At the same time, some people believe that it is not really are. I completely disagree with this point of view and this essay I will try to prove my opinion.
Firstly, for each of us sport take a huge role in our lives. When you grow up you should do sport to be healthier and stronger in your future life. For instance, the most of us in our childhood prefered to spend our free time to take part in different sport activities such as football, basketball or attent the events at the stadiums and etc. The exercises help us to built our character and rise our muscels, also it bring us the new communications and people.
But doing sports it is not the only way to do it. A lot of activities in the pandemic period had to be without fans there. And most of them were at online format, but it can not be a barrier for people who are intersted in it. They prefer to watch the sport events on TV, because they have no opportunity to attend it every time and also it brings them specific feelings such as asart, increasing interest and others. Some of the people are do it the whole of their life and they are enjoy to watch it especially with friends, collegues, family and so on.
To summarise, in my opinion, sport in every way of translation is a good way to spend the time. Also it can be a good reason to meet with friends and other people and to share your emotions with them.
