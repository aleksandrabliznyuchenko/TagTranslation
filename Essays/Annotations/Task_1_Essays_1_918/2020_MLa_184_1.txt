The given bar charts represent the information about Facebook users over a year-long period between March 2012 and March 2013. The charts show the differences between the platforms Facebook is used on and the main reasons to use the social network among men and women.
It can be clearly stated that in one year the number of desktop Facebook users slightly decreased from approximately 150 million to nearly 135 million. At the same time, the number of mobile app users soared increasing more than 1.5 times from less than 60 million up to over 90 million people.
In terms of gender trends, female Facebook users tend to use the social network for sharing photos and videos, scrolling through funny posts and learning about ways to help others, whereas for male audience these categories are not that important (54, 43, 35 per cent and 39, 35, 25 per cent respectively). Needless to say that men and women equally value Facebook as a platform for receiving updates.
By and large, Facebook users are using mobile app more and more. Also, women use Facebook for the most common reasons people open social network pages.
