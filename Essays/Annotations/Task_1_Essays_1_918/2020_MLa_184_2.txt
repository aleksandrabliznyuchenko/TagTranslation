Modern technologies allow people to watch their favourite sports events in any given time. However, there is a concern in society that a lot of people simply waste time as they are watching sports in ane shape or form.
To my mind, watching sports can never be considered a waste of time. Firstly, you may not be able to play sports for any reason, but still love sports with it's atmosphere and spectacularity. Secondly, nobody would argue that it may be a way for you to relax after a long day. Live sports events may be a prime example as they attract thousands of people. Moreover, you can easily point that all of those people are definitely into sports in some form and for them it is never a waste of time. For them it is a more of a lifestyle.
At the same time, some people are concerned that people watch sports for no distinct reason and simply waste their time with no value. In these people's point of view there ti so reason for you to watch sports if you are not a sportsman yourself. However, take a look at people making bets on sports games and making money out of it. Even though they do not play sports, their knowledge and experience helps them to earn money, thus they have to watch sports regularly.
All things considered, I strongly believe that watching sports in most cases can not be considered a waste of time. To my mind, people are willing to de whatever they want especially in scope of their personal life and hobbies.
