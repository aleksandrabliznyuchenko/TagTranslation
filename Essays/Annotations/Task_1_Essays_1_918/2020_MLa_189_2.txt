It is common belief that watching sports on TV or attendending sport activities in order to wath it - is just waste of time. I am strongly convinced that there is no something negative in having a hobby like this.
My first argument in supporting my opinion is that every person has a right to have every hobby he/she likes. So, if the person prefer to wach sports, he might do it and it is rather better than not having a activity he/she likes at all. In addition, sometimes people have a bad mood or even a depression because they cannot find sommething exciting and enjoyable for them. What is more, having a hobby like this allows people to make their days interesting and it is not a silly waste of time. My second argument is that wathing sports gather different people together. When people have their favourite team or maybe an adorable sportsman, it gives them apportunity to speak on this topic and share with ideas with others who has the same interests. Mereover, people might share some significant moments together, for instance, winning or loosing of a team, they might support each other. A felling of being a part of a big society makes people believe in theirselves, even in some cases it gives them a reason for living. Also, as a positive result, a person can meet his/her lifepartner or best friends in such communities, they can find someone simillar to them. From my point of view, we cannot say that something what makes people happy could be a waste of time. In conclusion, despite my respect to the opposite opinion, i suppose that wathing sports is mich more than just a way of spending time. In some cases it brings people a great felling - felling that they are alive.
