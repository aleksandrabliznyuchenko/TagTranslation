Some people think that watching sport events on TV or in real live is a waste of time. I strongly disagree with these people. As for me, watching sport can be very profitable for your mental or even physical health.
First of all, watching sport gives you a lot of positive emotions. By watching some sport events you can claim the atmosphere and get in to it. It can help you to start doing something yourself and do not scare it. Also, watching your favourite sportsmen gives you a felling like you are together. People celebrate the win of their team all over the world, does not matter where they are. Especially now, then COVID-19 is all around, people want to follow their favourite teams. Watching sport give you a feeling that your are a member of the team. That is more, watching sport events can help person for physical heath. By watching sport on TV or in real life, you can point some things, exersizes and movings which will help you to keep in shape in a future. Moreover, if you are a semi-profetional sportsmen, you simply should watch translations of your sport. It will help a lot to understand how profetionals do it and become profetional yourself.
To conclude, I would like to say that watching sport events is one of the most useful spending of time. Not only because it could be fun, but also because it need mental and physical activity. There are not stupid players and fans. They work hard together.
