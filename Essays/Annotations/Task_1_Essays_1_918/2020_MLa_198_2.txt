There is a widespread opinion that watching sports in live or in TV shows is a wasting time. However, I am absolutely do not agree with this statement. I assume that pass time like this is a great opportunity to relax or even to fell new emotions that people cannot feel in their everyday life. The obvious argument in watching sports favour is an opportunity to receive emotions and feelings that cannot appear in our lifestyle. Beyond our wildest expectations, unfortunately, our typical life is unable to give us such emotions like courage, adrenaline, spirit of competition and even happiness. Sports is one of the much easiest way to get it and to share it with other people. Moreover, according to several American researches, the most important beneficial aspect of sports is endorphine deluge that make us feel better and happy.
Furthermore, watching sports may be the only one way to feel yourself as a part of the whole sport community. It means that if person has not a chance to do sports by himself due to several reasons (for example, he or she is disabled or even an invalid or may be he or she has not enough financial resources for special sport equipment) passing time like watching live sport events becomes the only one way for personal developing in this field. In order to feel happiness people always find out different niches for self-development that allow them to feel the truly life. In conclusion, I tend to think that this kind of involvement in sports is much more better than life without it at all. Someone would say that this kind of passtime is equal to sedentary lifestyle but, fortunately, there are several undisputed points like endorphine deluge that makes us happy and personal developing that prevail the opposite point of veiw.
