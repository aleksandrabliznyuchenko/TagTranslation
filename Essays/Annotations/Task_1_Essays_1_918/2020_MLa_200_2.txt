There is no doubt that time in modern world has became one of the most expensive resources. More and more people think how to safe their time and use it right. That is the reason for critics of watching sport.
The first thing that i would like to say that watching sport really does not give me any new knowledges. For example, when i go to the football or decide to look some sports on TV i cannot read any new usefull book or to do some self-education. My attention is not consantrate. It is loud around me.
The second arguement that watching sport is a waste of my time is the estimating of myself problem. When i have a look at the powerful and ideal bodies of sportsmen i may do my opinion that i am not so good. That is the reasons of painful visiting of gym or harmful diet. That is why many people think that sport is not so good that it is announced.
In opposite side we all should remember that studyng lessons, reading books and self-education are really very important but we cannon ignore our needs to have free time for relaxing. We all neet some time to meet our family and friends, to play some football or to watch it.
In conclusion i would like to notice that all opinions are right. The purpose is to find the position when watching sports is just a pause in long way to do yourself and have some free time to refresh your power and resourses.
