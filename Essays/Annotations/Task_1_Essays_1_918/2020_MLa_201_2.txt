It is common saying that watching sports is a waste of time. While one person gets from this type of event a lot of fun, another one could not understand the key feature of this action. In this essay I want to discuss both views and explain my personal opinion about this issue.
For the one hand, watching sports can involve people into new sphere of hobby. For example, a lot of persons can not imagine their life without some sports events. They enjoy the process of waiting for some important date when they can meet their fan-team friends to watch a match with their favorite team. As for me, I used to play computer games before I started watching football matches. The atmosphere of football game, its rules and community made me start playing football and get dipper in football sphere. After that period, watching sports became my main hobby, because I really enjoy it and found strong fan community of my favorite football team. That is why a lot of people can argue with statement of wasting time on sports events.
For the over hand, some people think that watching sports is not useful and usually lead to wasting time. Moreover watching sports is less healthy process then playing sports. Fans running to the TVs for their favorite sports events just like a zombies, ignoring their free time which they could spend with family. Often this type of leisuring connected with eating junk food and drinking alcohol, so that fans could be fat and unhealthy. For these type of fans doing sports is much better then watching.
To sum up I want mention that all hobbies and activites have a chance to be in our lifes. Every person should think about hobbies and what he or she consider as wasting time, and what action is more relative to their leisure.
