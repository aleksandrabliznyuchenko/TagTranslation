Nowadays it is popular to be healthy, support healthy lifestyle, go to gym, or just jogging. Does it means, that in that rythm of life people should add wathcing sport without taking part? Some people really believe, that it is a necessary part of life, others claim that it is foolish waste of time. I stand on the opinion that if you like what you watch, it could not be a waste of time. on one hand, it is an important part of sport life. First of all, it could be learning video about sport you do, what will help you to make your skills better. Whate is more, there are technics in sport that could hurt a person if he or she doesn't now it. Moreover, watching sport is a great opportunity to spend time with friends or family. If it is some game, or olympadian sport, you could support your team or country, what is very amazing.
On the other hand, there are negative points about topic. I mentioned the idea of healthy lifestyle, but sitting on the sofa and watching sport couldn't help to make a body of dream, for example. Some people call themselves sportsmen, nevertheless, they eat food full of cholesterin and prefer taxi the walking. In such situation, when watching sport is just a "show" for society, that is really waste of time. Honestly, I still believe that watching sport is necessary and just interesting. By that way, people could learn something or have a pleasure and fun.
All in all, there are two point of view on this topic. Person could watch sport and be happy thanks to that, or if he believe that it is waste of time, don't do it and respect the choice of others. In conclusion, it is important to say, that in should be done if a person want and like such spending of time.
