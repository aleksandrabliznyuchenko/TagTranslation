In modern world sport is popular thing, people all over the world watching sport events. There is some people who says, that watching sports is a waste of time, i disagree with that. In my opinion sport is one of the greatest thing of the world. Firstly, sport is emotions, and not only for athletes, but for fans. This is why people around the world love and watching sports.
One of the most popular event in sport is football Champions League. Every year the best European teams fight for this trophy and millions fans watch it on TV or live. That sport event is a real treat for fans. Families watch this together and every match began a holiday. Watching this sport event making people happy and that one of reason why it is not waste of time. Do not forget that watching sports is motivating people. When children see a great boxer like Muhammad Ali or great football player like Lionel Messi, they want be like them. This motivation protects them from drugs, alcohol, cigarets, these children goes to gyms and starting work for they dream. Great athletes always motivated new generation and after that appeared a new great athletes, this is constant circle and that is good.
Summarizing, it becomes clear, that watching sport is not waste of time. For many people sport is a holiday, that makes them happy. For other people it is a motivation. There is no wasting of time, there is only benefits.
