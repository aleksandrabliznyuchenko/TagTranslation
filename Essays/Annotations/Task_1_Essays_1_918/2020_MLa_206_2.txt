It is popularly believed that watching sports (either on TV or at live sports events) is a waste of time. However, I disagree with that statement about wasting time. I would like to explain my point of view on this situation.
To begin with, watching TV - it's a great relaxing in leisure time. By watching TV you can learn something entertaining such as sport rules or something about sport teams. Different kinds of sports are enjoyed by sport lovers around the world and most people have their own favorite sport. Nowadays, watching sports has become one of the common leisure activity and lots of people spend hours sitting in front of TV. In my opinion, watching sports is not a waste of time but there should be a balance between the time spent on watching sports and taking part in their social and sports activities.
Firstly, watching sports is an excellent form of entertainment. People can improve their knowledge and skills on kinds of sports that people can learn it by watching.
On the other hand, some people think that of watching sport can do any other things such as reading books and so on, Additionally it is that doing some sports are more acceptable than watching TV. Moreover, lots of people claim that watching sports TV to kill one's spare time is not a worthy activity To conclude, watching sports in leisure time is a good way of spending time and for some people this hobby can be useful in the educational sphere. We have to maintain a symmetry in our leisure activities, people should do anything where they feel yourself happy.
