Nowadays there are many debates whether watch sport events is good or bad way to spend time. I suppose it is not a waste of time because you can learn from watching professional athletes and if you like to do something is not a waste of time. First of all, there are plenty of people who do sports and do it greatly. Consequently, men and women who watch sportsmen's trainings or games can see what they do and how that is handful for people to learn some movements and tricks to develop their sport skills. Moreover, watching athletes can be very useful for children and especially for children who do not have professional athletes around them and can not be taught by people with experience in sports. For example, my friend used to be an athlete and do martial arts but there were no person who could show how to be excellent in martial arts in her family, anyway, she had phone and Wi-fi to watch sport events where professionals participated, as a result, she learned many new things which could help her. It can be stated that watching sport events is even needed to some people.
Second point is that things what you enjoy are not bad and can not be considered as a waste of time, because they are pleasurable for you and do not harm. Every person likes to have some habits for relaxing and their leisure time and that is absolutely fine they can rest after work, make their mind clear from stressful thoughts and be distracted for some time. Consequently, they will calm down and enjoy free time, there is even saying "if something make you happy, it is not a waste of time". For instance, it was explored that having some habits to relax and enjoy can be good for your mental health because it decreases your stress level.
To sum it up, to watch sports can be even useful for person because there are many things to learn and that habit can reduce stress.
