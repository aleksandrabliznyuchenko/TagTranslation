Nowadays the issue of watching sport is often debated all over the world. Some people strongly believe that watching sport on the TV or at stadiums has plenty of positive moments, while others claim watching sport programs has bad influence and it is a waste of time. I disagree with the second position and claim that sport on TV or in the special places has lots of benefits and advantages.
Firstly, some people must watch sport in different ways, online or offline, due to this profession. There are a lot of sport journalists and critics and their salary depends on articles, which they write. Without watching matches or plays journalist can't write sport article and he can make a redundant. Moreover, coaches should watching sport in different views, since the coach has an opportunity to see some interesting and smart sport techniques and learn his team to do this. For example, football trainer of "Zenit" watches "Barcelona" matches to know something new and apply to practice and, for instance, to win the tournament.
Secondly, some people watch sport with children to instill them love to sport. 5 or 6 years old children have chance to chose some hobby, but usually they don't know what they like to do and parents begin to show some sport games or matches or some championships, like Figure Skating Championship or others. After watching some sport programs or live sport events child can chose a hobby and this hobby can to become child's vocation in the future.
To sum up, I disagree with the statement that watching sport is a useless way to spend time. I believe that watching sport has many advantages, which help people in different ways and in different spheres, for instance, relax or earn money.
