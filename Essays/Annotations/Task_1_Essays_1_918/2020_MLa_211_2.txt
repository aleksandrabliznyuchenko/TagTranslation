It is undeniable that sport has become an integral part of our life. The difference is only in the fact that sombody prefers doing sport and somebody wants just to watch it and cheer. Anyway there are people who watch TV and live sport events. Some people believe that such a pastime is a wasting of time. Others claim that it's not as useless as it is thought to be.
I'm inclined to believe that watching spots is definitety is not a waste of time. To begin with, watching sport competitions rallies and increases the level of patriotsm. When it comes to major championships, then rooting for an athlete of your country or city means supporting sportsmen and showing your patriotism. This is especially evident during the Olympics and World Championships.
In addition, such pasttime provides a chance to throw out emotions and get rid of emotional stress. Any sport game or competiton (even single sports) give you the opportunity to empathize with certain atheletes. It gives you emotions: makes your happy, when your favourite sportsman wins or makes you sad if it's not.
However, there are some people who are convinced that watching sports is the same like doing nothing. Such people think that is doen't bring any benefits. However they dont't realise that sport TV programs are much more useful than TV shows or soap operas.
In conclusion I strongly believe that pastime at sports TV shows and live sports events are useful for the formation of a patriotic society with low levels of stress.
