Nowadays, there is a multitude of ways how to entertain yourself. Some people watch sports on TV or even visit live sports events and like this activity. Some people think that this type of activity is just a waste of time. Let me express my point of view on this problem.
When it comes to me, I disagree that watching sports is a waste of time. Watching sports can help people earn money. People who often watch sports or visit such events are really keen on that, so that they become experts. These people can analyze matches and make forecasts for future matches. These abilities make the way of entertaining into the way of making money. Moreover, watching sports can affect people to do sport by themselves. Poeple see their favourite players and often want to become as good as them. That is why watching sports can improve the mindset of the spectator and make his life healthier.
On the other hand there is opposite side of view on this problem. These people argue that watching sports is a waste of time. It is better to read a book or study something new. Therefore, they believe that if a man loves watching sport, he also loves drinking and eating unhealthy food. The reason is that it becomes boring just to watch match and do not eat or do anything else.
However, those people forget that it is not necessary to work hard everyday. People should have a rest day and do anything what they want to reboot themselves. Moreover, it is not so harmful to have one day rest and eat or drink unhealthy food. And if person is really interested in match, he will not think about something else like food or drinks.
To sum up, there are different points of view on this problem. However I strongly believe that everyone should do what he wants, that is why watching sports is not a waste of time.
