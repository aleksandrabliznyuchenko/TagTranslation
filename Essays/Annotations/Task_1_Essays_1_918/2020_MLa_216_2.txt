Many people are sure that they lost time watching sports on TV or going to sports events. They think that they do not do something useful. I absolutely disagree this opinion.
Firstly, watching sports lets people feel themselve better. A lot of people work hard and feel tired when they come home. One of the best way to relax and have fun is to watch TV. It can be programmes with comics and jokes. At the same time, some people prefer to watch sport shows or translations. For instance, two days ago I watched track and field on my TV. I was so excited to follow my favourite athlet! After the school I had no emotional forces to do something, but this sport translation gave me a lot of fun.
Secondly, live sport events let people feel that they do not lonely. Some people live alone and do not communicate with other. When people decide to go to sport complex and watch sport event, they can make new friends and spend time with someone together. For example, last September I went to the footbal match. I felt lonely because my friends and parents did not enjoy sport with me. But then I met new friends and had fun with them. We are going to watch sports together later.
In conclusion, I disagree that watching sports is a waste of time. I am sure that it can let people have relax and make new friends.
