Nowadays sport events have become important worldwide as politicians, sport organizations and even fans have their own motives to watch it. I am strongly disagree with the opinion that sport as an entertainment, but not action, does not bring anything usefull to someone's life or for the society. I believe that being a part of the community of sport fans is highly important in the modern world.
To begin with, I want to mention that big sport events such as the Olympic Games unite people around the globe. If we speak about visiting the Games, it is a chance for different nations to get closer and create friendship relations. Moreover, even those who can't visit the country of the Olympic's often meet in bars or sport clubs to watch them together. Fans have a wide range of opportunities to make friends.
The other important point is that many of today's famouse sportsmen started by only watching their favorit sport matches. Showing games on the TV as well as organising special events allows thousends of children (and not only) to open sport as their future career or longterm hobby.
Next reason to keep watching sport is economic of the country. It is not a secret that sport is the most profitable part of national budget. Each year events and TV shows bring billions of dollars to the qwner's organizations which is millions of taxes paid.
In conclusion, since the ancient times sport has played a key role in human lifes, so today we should keep respecting that fact and as not everyone is able to do sport because of the problems with health or money watching different games and visiting big sport events brings satisfaction and new abilities into people's life.
