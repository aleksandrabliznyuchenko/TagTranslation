We are presented with the two distinct diagrams showing various statistics regarding the use of Facebook. The first bar plot illustrates the changes in total number of users (grouped by the source of visit) in a one-year period from 2012 up to 2013, while the second chart represents the reasons why the opposite genders might use this social network.
The first plot shows that in March 2012 there were nearly 150 million users who came from a desktop version of the network and around 60 millon who visited this service via their mobile phone. By March 2013 the number of desktop users declined by 20 millions to the point of 130 million annual users. However, the use of Facebook on smarthphones rose considerably by 40 per cent and went up to almost 100 million visits per year.
The second chart depicts the reasoning behind the use of Facebook grouped by gender. We can see that around 54% of females visit their profiles in order to share some photo or video materials, and only 39% of males are guided by the similar reason. Equal number of people (39% in each group), regardless of gender, are motivated by getting some fresh information. A little bit more women (43%) than men (35%) are interested in seeing funny posts. Finally, females outweight males in expressing readiness to learn about opportunities of helping others (35% against 25%, respectfully).
To conclude, we can observe an apparent trend of switching from desktops to gadgets for using social networks just in one-year period from 2012 to 2013. The total number of Facebook users grew during this period, as well. However, we can also state that the opposite genders are motivated by slightly different reasons when visiting this website.
