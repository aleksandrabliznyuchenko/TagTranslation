Nowadays, various kinds of sports are very popular among people of all ages around the world. We have a possibility to participate different sports games and events or attend it for watching. However, some people believe that the last is just a wasting of time. In my opinion, it is not true because watching sports may be so breathtaking and useful as participating.
Firstly, you can find a lot of new friends and soulmates. For example, if you are watching a football game from the stadium, you can meet and stars communicate with other football fans. The common favourite sport team is the great theme for conversation! Maybe you have other common interests and you can find a friend for the all life! Secondly, while watching sports you can feel nervous and inspiring like you are on the field. You can experience the all spector of feelings and it is not nesessary to be in a great shape and participate sport games and events. Finally, watching sports on TV is a good decision for have a rest after a hard day. You can cook delisious dinner and eat it with all family around TV. Close people, the common interest and warm atmosphere at home is the best way to relax in the evening!
To sum up, I would like to say, that wathing sports at live sports events or on TV is not always a waste of time. Sometimes it can be funny and exiting as participating. It is also a great way to find new friends and it should be mentioned that it is absolutely safe!
