According to spme people, spending their free time time for watching any types of sport simply kills precios time. However, i do not agree with this statement because in my opinion it is a useful activity and has mane advantages.
Firstly, watching a team sports in your free time can learn you a few things, such as cooperation and team spirit. Sport teams demonstrate a huge level of team spirit that can be aplied in everyday life. What is worth the recent NBA final, when the Maimi Heat team without their two best players won two matches, even when all prophesied them a "dry" defeat. In addition, by watching a game we can learn a lot about it, that is how i started playing basketball. I watch sports with my friend and family, it is a great to spend some time with them. It is cool moments, when I can cheer for Los Angeles Lakers with my brother or best friend together, it bring us closer. Therefore, watching sports gives many advantages that are so necessary in all areas of our life. Sport fans often have role models that fascinate them the most, for me this is Kobe Brayant for example. Fans thy to copy them and follow ther methods to stay in good shape, like healthy diet or trainig program. Some of them get inspiration from sport stars and choose sport as their career. For example a lot of NBA players or any non pro basketball players where inspired by Jordan. Or curent captain of Los Angeles Lakers, Lebron James, was inspired by former captain Kobe Brayant and dreamed of being a legend of this team just like him. With considerable dedication and hard work, he acheved this and won NBA with LAL in this year. There are many such stories where a particular sport has inspired people.
In conclusion, watching sports in leisure time is a good way of spending it and for some guys this hobby may even turn into a career. So, people should encourage their children to develop interest in sport by watching it.
