It is often argued that it is loss of time both visiting sport events and watching broadcasts of the matches on TV. I completely disagree with this opinion and think this activity is one of the best option to spend your leisure time either with family or alone.
Firstly, watching sports is a great way to get a motivation and make yourself feel better. Another way to express, after the win of the favorite club or a certain sportsman people usually celebrate it by meeting with friends and discussing key moments of the match at the bar or at home. For example, the French football fans was celebrating the victory of their national team for several days and gives plenty vivid moments to themselves and for the surroundings.
Therefore, those moments bring the unbelievable experience and stuck in the memory forever.
Secondly, people who watch sports often, can also make bets on sporting events and obtain some money. In other words, by analyzing outcomes of the previous games, fans can try to predict the next games and probably be right. For instance, one football fan in 2017 has bet 10 pounds on the first place of Leister in Premiere league and won money.
