Some people are deeply convinced that watching sporting events is a waste of time. However, I disagree with this statement, as it helps to develop all-round and have fun.
On the one hand, watching sports programmes or sport matches takes up time that you could spend on yourself. People suffer from health problems, but they watch an athletics show every day. Moreover, people will have more brighter and more useful time if they themselves sign up for any sports courses. For instance, according to statistics, people spend on average about 4 hours a day watching TV sports. If they direct ghese hours to their physical health, and not empty pastime, they can got a lot of advantages.
On the other hand, when people watch sports programs or go to various sports games, they develop all-round. Sometimes it is not enough just to play sports, it is important to understand it. After all, when people look at someone else s game in practice, we analyze their mistakes and at the same time learn, improving our skills in sport. For example, if you play tennis, then you know that this a common practice, when the coach literally makes you watch other people s games to improve your abilities. Moreover, walking together on some games or watching a match on the couch together is a good way to get closer with your family or friends. After all when you are a fan of the team, then you all worry together.
In conclusion, it would not be a great exaggeration to say that even though some people are convinced that sports games are useless nonsense, in my opinion, thanks to them all people develop and become closer.
