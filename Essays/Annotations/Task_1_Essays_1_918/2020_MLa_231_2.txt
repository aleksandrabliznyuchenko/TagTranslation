Sport is important part of our life. Someone has an opportunite to make it a commercial benefit. Sport professions are really interesting and need a lot of time for trainings and competitions. Sportsmen often have different problems with their health because of their job means using physical opportunites of body.
I disagree that watching sports is a wasting of time and want to argue my opinion.
First of all, it is a wonderful opportunite for spending holiday time with family. There are some kinds of sport events where will be interesting and safe for people of all ages, in some cases football and hockey competitions could be dangerous for kids. Competition in swimming, skiing, skating and other sports are fantastic and emotional. More over, it could be a good example for children.
Secondly, watching sports on TV and at live sports events is a pleasant spending of time for people who was a sportsman in past. Obviously, it is an important part of their life and sometimes they want to have the feelings of competition, win and proud for team. There are such cases when men and women have been injured during their professional career. It is difficult to believe esspecially for people who pay by oppotunites of their body. These people are often invited for sport events for free, so it could be a great emotional belief.
To conclude, sport is interesting part of our life in modern life. There are lots of kind sport, so you can find yours.
