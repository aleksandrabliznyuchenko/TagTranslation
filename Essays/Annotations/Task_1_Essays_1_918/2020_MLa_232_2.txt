Nowadays some amount of people are considered that wathing sports is a waste of time and money. However, there are others, who claim that this activity is a good way to spend time profitable and interesting.
As for my mind, I am convinced that such hobby as wathing sports is an integral part of modern culture, every day we find out the latest news happening in the world, just as we should follow the events taking place in sports. First of all, people can learn more about new sports disciplines and it can help them to improve their memory and expand the mind. For instance, if some person is interested in team sports, such as football, basketball or voleyball it is able to learn him how to behave in a team. After all, when a person are aware of everything new, that apears, he or she can take an active part in it.
Moreover, when a person is whatching sports at live sports events, it has a lot of benefits. For example, person could find new friends with the same hobby as his or her or even to talk with his or her sports idol and to find out some secrets of success.
However, there is another point of view. Some people have strogh belief that a person who spends a lot of time watching sports on TV or at live sports events, never would not gain any access in sports.
I can not completely agree with the above statement. If a person have a goal and a dream, this hobby could not prevant this person.
In conclusion, taking everything into acount, benefits have a bigger amount in comparison with drawbacks. If a person want to be successful in some sport, he or she must be ambitious and have a huge interest in this sport.
