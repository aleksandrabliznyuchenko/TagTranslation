According to some people, spending free time by watching sport matches or translation is just killing precious time. As for me, I don't agree with these people, because in my opinion it is useful activity and has many advantages.
To start with, watching sport games is an amazing form of entertainment. It is pleasure and way of relaxion for many and in most situations people prefer to watch sports with their friends, which is a great way of socialising. I believe, that watching sports on TV or in the Internet has become an event of socialising and communicating between people from different parts of the world. However, don't forget that spending a lot of time in front of TV or a computer can negatively affect your health.
The next argument which I want to mentioned is skills and knowledge which we can to get during watching the sport. To begin with, by watching sports in free time we can learn things such as cooperation and team spirit. Sport teams exhibit a tremendous level of team spirit that we can apply in our daily life. Also, while watching the game, we can gain immense knowledge about it.
To conclude, we can say that watching sports games is not only a great way to relax and socialize, but also a great opportunity to gain new knowledge and skills that can be useful in everyday life.
