These days, every time you turn on the television and flick through the channels, you may note that the live stream of some sport event or just showing some sport iy is not an outstanding thing. Some people believe that sitting in front of the TV screen or watching some game in the stadium is thee senseless waste of time, while others claim that we can benefit from this past-time, while. I completely disagree with the idea given in the topic and in this easy i will support my opinion with examples.
To start with when it comes sport event, a person can relax and enjoy his or her time watching a game. No important whether he or her goes to the stadium or stays at home, it can be beneficial affect on his or her health.
Another reason why i disagree with watching sports as a waste of time is that event like this can be an amazing reason for the whole family to come and spend the evening together.
I strongly believe that, in such a circumstance, watching sports cannot be regarded as a dawdiling.
On the other hand, there is an argument that all the sports event come along with an unhealthy food. No matter where this event taken place, junk food and alcoholic drinks are consumed.
As a result, such an events turn out to be the one more reason for increasing obesity and other diseases.
Therefore, it can be regarded as a waste of time for nothing beneficial happens.
In conclusion, although it is common belief that watching sports is the waste of time, i find this affirmation too reckless snd thoughtless affirmation. Personally, i think watching sport events, both at home in the stadium, is a great activity and every person can benefits from it,
