We are given two charts with the information about using Facebook.
In the first chart we can see that in comparison with 2012 in March of 2013 the number of Facebook users descreased quite dramatically both on desktops and mobile phones. In March of 2012 over 150 million people used the social media on their laptops, and in 2013 it was less than 60 million. We can notice the same phenomenon with mobile phones. The number of users fell from almost 140 to less than a hundred million people. Plus, It is obvious that people tend to use the Faceook app on mobile phones rather than on computers.
In the second chart we can notice that the most popular reason for both men women to use Facebook is sending photos and videos to their friends. Moreover, men also use it mostly to receive updates and new information. In the second place for both women and men seeing funny photos, or "memes", on the Internet.
To conclude, there are not as many users of Facebook as there were several years ago, and most of them prefer to use it on their phones. Nevertheless, it can still be useful for work or help people to have a good time watching something funny.
