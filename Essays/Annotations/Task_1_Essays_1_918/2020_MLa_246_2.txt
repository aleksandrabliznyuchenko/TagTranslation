Some people think that watching sports on TV or at sports events is a waste of time, whereas others belive that it is not. I believe that every person should do sports in their lives, but it is not a waste of time if everyone who likes sport or sport events will watch it at home or at sports areas. I disagree with the statement and will try to support my opinion in that essay.
Firstly, every person has a chance to visit a real football or basketball matchs if he really want it. There are a lot of big zones and areas for sports events in every country, sity and so on. So, it will be very crucial for the economics of the country if there was not people on sports events. Accoording to statistics of one Saint-Petersburg magazine which is called Fontanka, there was an information about Zenit arena which is the most expensive sport building in Russia, that it was really owful time when was the start of pandenimia in a sity, because evrything was closed and there was nobody at the stadium and the economics of Zenit arena was gradually decreased. That is why it is not a waste of time to go and watch the match in a real life. In that way we can support our sport teams and economics of sport at all.
Secondly, it is very good if a person like to do some exercises or do sport, but there are people who can not doing some kinds of sport because of the health restrictions. There are a lot of people who can just sit at home and watch every kind of sport that he prefer. So, in that way it is not a waste of time for people who have some problems with health but they like sport.
In conclusion i would like to say that sport is a very important part of country's cultural events and everyone shoud choose where he really like to watch it. It is better if a big amount of people can do sports activities because it makes them healthy and strong but everyone should remember that there are others who can just watch.
