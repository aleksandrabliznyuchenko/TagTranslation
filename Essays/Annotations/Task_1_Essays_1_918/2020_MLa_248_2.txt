Nowadays there is an opinion that spending your free time by watching different sports events and competitions is useless. Some people think this is a resonable point of view, while others have absolulely different state of mind. Personally, i believe that this is not really correct statement, because there are a lot of positive sides of this occupation.
To begin with, watching sports is really an exciting process. While you watch any kind of sport event, you root for your favourite team or sportsmen, compare them with the competitors, you worry about the results, yell and sometimes even cry. All of this stuff gives you an opportunity to feel the whole spectrum of emotions, so that is why watching sports, no matter on TV or live, is truly an exciting way of spending time. Another reason supporting my opinion is that watching sports helps people to learn more about different kinds of sports and its aspects. The more you know, the more versatile and interesting person you are. Therefore, if you understand various sports and aware of the latest sport news, you will be able to maintain a lot of conversations with your friends or relatives and this will make you a good interlocutor.
In conclusion i disagree with the opinion that watching sports is a complete waste of time, as this occupation brings a lot of advantages or just positive effects for the person who decided to watch some kind of sport competition or event either on TV or live.
