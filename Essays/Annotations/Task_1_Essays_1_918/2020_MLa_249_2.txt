The question about whether following different sport events is an important habit or a pointless thing that does not make any sense has always been surrounded by heated debates. I fully agree with the first point of view for the following reasons.
Such type of entertainment as wathing sports has a huge amount of bright sides. To start with, there is no doubts that comparing to another kinds of TV-programmes like soap-operas or activities like playing computer games this particular one has much more advantages. For instance, you can have a great and unforgettable time watching it with your friens or family. In many countries it became an important tradition to watch some sports events on TV or visiting stadiums to cheer your favourite team. Therefore, it consolidates people who are fans of concrete sports clubs.
What is more, looking up for upcoming sports events can cultivate the interest in this field and a will to do sports or at least lead a healthy life-style. For example, many people who are huge sport stars now while interviews were telling that their careers were started due to the inspiration given them by other sports icons that they saw on the TV or alive. Summarizing all the things mentioned above, it should be said that being interested in wathing sports is not the worst habit. Being involved in such activity can make you feel a part of a bigger community or even improve your relationships with family and friends. Furthermore, it can be a movation for you to start your own career in sport.
