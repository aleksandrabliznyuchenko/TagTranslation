Nowadays it is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore huge sport events. Sport events became really interesting to watch because of technological features and marketing. But there is an opinion that watching sports is just a waste of time. I do not agree with this statement. I personally think that watching sports is a great way of relaxing or hanging out with your friends or family. Key factor is that relaxing is not a waste of time. Firstly, watching big and famous sports events motivate ordinary people to do some sports. For example, my friend has been a footbal fan since he was seven, he has watched all games with his favourite team. When he was ten years old he asked his parents to go to a footbal section in his school. Nowadays my friend is 20 and he is a mature footbal player in a rather famous footbal team in his town. Secondly, watching sports is a great opportunity to spend your spare time and get lots of positive emosions. People who prefer watching sports when they have free time do not waste this time on alcohol, drugs, computer games and other harmful but popular ways of spending time. But some people will not agree with me. They provide an idea that watching sports is a bad way of spending time and money. Firstly these people think that betting companies and famous sportsmen especially footbal players just make money on their fans. They do not create anything except emotions. Secondly there are a lot of agressive hooligans who always make sabotage during and after sports events.
Finally I want to say that I do not feel as I am in a driver's seat when speaking about sport. As for me watching sports is a kind of motivtion and a way of spending my spare time with my friends.
