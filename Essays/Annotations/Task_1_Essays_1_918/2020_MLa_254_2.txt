Nowadays sports is an intergal part of many individuals' lives. A lot of people do sports. At the same time many people enjoy watching it live or on TV. There are some growing debates on watching sports games. Lots of people think it is a waste of time and I agree with them. In my opinion, people should not watch sports much for several reasons.
Watching sports may be harmful for people's health. Many sports TV programmes last long. For example, soccer game takes more than 1.5 hours. When a person watches it on TV, they have a strong pressure on their spine because they usually spend the whole time in one position. Moreover, it is harmful for people's eyes to watch TV for such long period and follow every movement of a sportsman. Besides, people often eat unhealthy snacks.
While watching sports at the stadium people also suffer. Firstly, they spend time in one poisture, their eyes hurt because sometimes people have to sit far away from the sportsmen. It is also important that people face the crowd during such events and it could be very dangerous to enter and leave the stadium as well as to use the subway without proper police regulation. Finally, people tend to eat junk food at the stadium due to the fact that the food and drinks you bring from home are prohibited.
To sum up, I conclude that it is up to every person to decide how to spend their leisure time but I strongly recommend people to change their focus from watching sports to doing it. It would provide everyone with joy and strengthen their health.
