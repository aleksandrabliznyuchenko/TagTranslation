Undoubtedly, sport is a huge part of our life, because all people want to live longer and stay healthy. Moreover, watching sports in no less attractive. Some people believe that watching sports is a waste of time. As for me, I strongly disagree with this statement and will prove my opinion with some arguments in this essay.
The first argument supporting the idea that watching sports is a great way to spend free time is that watching sports can be one of the opportunities to chill with friends or family. Friends or family members can choose their favourite team and watch all the games where this team takes part in. This way of spending time together can help to strengthen relations, for example, my father and grandfather often visit football plays on a stadium, they share news about work and family and enjoy a great game.
Secondly, watching sports may help a person to cut himself or herself from a daily routine. Our generation has a lot of stress, especially in huge cities, we are sometimes overwhelmed by monotonous exercises, we need a hobby to let our emotional steam off. While watching sports, some people can shout or even cry, it hepls them to relax and forget about problems in real life. The last but not least argument is that watching sports can stimulate doing sports, because some people associate themselfs with popular and rich sportsmens and want to be alike. To demonstrate, I have a friend who watches sports all his life and once, when he was 12 years old, he decided to start swimming professionally. Nowadays, he is extremely successful and wins most of championships in Russia and in Europe.
To conclude everything mentioned above, watching sports is definitely not a waste of time, because this hobby can be shared with family or friends, it helps to provides positive emotions and may be a reasons to do sports in real life.
