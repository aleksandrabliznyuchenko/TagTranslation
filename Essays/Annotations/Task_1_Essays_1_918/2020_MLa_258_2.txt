Some people say that watching sports and sports TV programme is a waste of time. In my opinion watching TV programmes is a waste of time but watching sports and sports TV programmes could be useful for ordinary people who likes sports and people who play sports.
For example, my friend Jack wants to become a hockey player. He is going to gym three times per week, study stick dribbling, every week going for skate etc. But when he wants to train tactic, he watches the National Hockey League where plays professional sportsmen and try to keep in mind some tricks and models of playing from people who play professional hockey.
Actually, ordinary people could watch sports on TV and in a stadium and this could very useful. Sometimes we have a negative emotion or we have an express our emotion to feel ourselves more confident or peacefully. When you watch sports, you may express any emotion or you get any positive emotion because sport is really fantastic. Any game could be quite interesting and, in that way, you can't unlock your eyes from that. But sports not an interesting for anyone and some people think that any sports is boring. In that way watching sports and sports TV programme is useless action.
My final onion that watching sports and sports TV programme is quiet useful action. It could be effective for amateur sportsmen for their involving skills and knowledges, and also it could be useful for ordinary people who want to express or get some emotions. In other way watching sports it's really boring and useless action and waste of time.
