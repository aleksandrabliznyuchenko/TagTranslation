The given charts reprecent two things about Facebook from 2012 to 2013: changes in people's preffered devices and the reasons to visit the site. Let's take a closer look.
On the first one we can see users log into with dekstops or mobile gadget. As for the PC we can notice a slight decrease in the number of visitors. It went down from approximately 150 to 137 millions. On the other hand mobiles show a rapid growth. Just in one year the number was nearly doubled from a bit over 55 millions to almsot 100 millions. However, a desktop it still the go-to device. With the next one some gender diffirences can be established. Only in one category men and women use Facebook equally and it is for "receiving updates". It worth to notice that the mentioned category is one of the two most popular for males. "Seeing funny posts" and "learning about ways to help others" are more popular amongst women then men. The most popular reason for women and also men is to "share photos/videos".
In conslusion we can see that the choice of a preffered device has changed and women have more reasons to visit the social media.
