Many people claim that watching sports is a waste of time. Others may consider it being an important part of their lives. Arguments for both opinion are presented further in this essay.
Firstly, watching sports can be part of some people's profession. For example, one is a professional basketball player, who needs to know their opponent team well. That is a situation when watching sports is directly a part of someone's job. Secondly, watching sports is an activity that usually becomes common interest for family members and unites them. For instance, people can travel through all the country with all their family to see their favorite team's game. Emotions are most likely involved in watching sports and in a crucial moment the whole family or even nation may experience the strong connection.
On the other hand, practical people may consider that watching sports is a waste of time and there is surely some arguments for it. Firstly, this activity is entertaining, which means one do not get any new knowledge or gain practical skills while watching sports. Secondly, there are many people who are not interested in doing sports, which logically leads to them being not attracted to it. It means there is nothing they can get from watching sports, neither in emotional nor in practical way. For example, watching soccer for one who does not like it or does not even know rules will seem as repetitive and boring game where 22 men are running around with a ball.
In conclusion, some people may consider watching sports as a waste of time when others can be very passionate about it. Personally I think that watching sports is important to strengthen the connection between people and make many of them truly happy.
