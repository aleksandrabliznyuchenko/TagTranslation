Nowadays a number of people believe that one of the ways of wasting your time is watching some sport stuff online or even offline. In my opinion, i am argee with this statement because when you watch sport activities you do not do it for yourself and if you do it usually it feels like one of the ways of procrastination.
Firstly, when you watch sport games you are not the part of it. If you are a fan of some sport - you spent this time on it because you enjoy this type of sport. However, fans can not really use some ideas that they can see in this event. They look at sportsmens and do not try to learn from them. This is why spending time on this seems like procrastination, because you do not use your time to learn something useful for yourself.
Secondly, watching sport can be also really damaging for your health. For example, sometimes some sport events can last for more than two or three hours, all this time you spend sitting somewhere and do not have any activity for your body. After this hours of doing nothing your body will be in need to do some physical work. But you prefer to watch another sport game. It is not physical work for your body which is good for it. It is time you do not give your body enough activity.
In conclusion, i would like to tell that even if sport events sounds like an interesting way to spend time, i is not that good for your body and also do not really useful if you are not professional sportsmen. I prefer to do some physical activity because this my body always feel better after work out and it will help me to be healthier in the future.
