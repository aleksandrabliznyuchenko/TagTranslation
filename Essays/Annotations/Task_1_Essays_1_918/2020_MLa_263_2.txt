There are a lot of various opinions if watching sports activities online is a bad decision that is killing time. I surely disagree with the statement for some reasons.
First of all, watching sport online safes extremely a lot of time. It is a well-known fact, that every week there are a lot of different competition all over the world, that may be interesting for many people. Online video-broadcasts from the sport location make possible see games from any city without wasting time on logistics costs. Every fan may watch FIFA or other sport competition after job shift from home. My father get together with his best friends every Sunday to watch football broadcasts and support their favorite team, that play in Europe.
Secondly, nowadays people more and more develop soft skills, one of them is multiprocessing. It allows to compare watching sport online and doing significant tasks. Due to multiprocessing fans can safe a lot of time doing several work at one moment. The great example of watching sport broadcasts and doing business shown in a film "Suits", where one lawyer watched competition of his girlfriend while he was sitting in a court.
To sum up, there is nothing like watching sport in spare time. Besides, for some people it can turn into a career that is why it can become an additional way of earning money. Due to this, parent should encourage their children to develop interest in sport by watching it and participation in various sport competition.
