It is considered that watching sportive games is useless and takes too much time. Others are convinced that it is a great hobby that develops best human qualities. In my opinion, watching sportive competitions is important and I agree with the second view.
Firstly, visiting sport events makes you feel a teammate and make you be social. During the game you have an opportunity to get along with people from other social classes, ages and professions. You can easily communicate with them because all of you a fan of one team. Moreover, the unreal pleasure brings the victory of yours team and you can get in touch with all members of your fan team at once. To illustrate, people of Russia had become more open and friendly between each other during the sport event in Sochi 2014. They had become one nation and one fan base.
Secondly, watching sports is a good way to support your friends or parents. It not only makes you being involved in the professional sphere of your close people, but it widespreads your word's view. Sport links people and makes feel care and family's attendance in life even they are far from you. As an example, my brother is a professional hockey player and I do my best to visit all his home games. While playing in Toronto all my family had watched the championship and his team won. When he came to Russia, he said that with our support and love he could believe in himself and he had showed his best skills.
To summarise, sporting events may grow the essential people's features.
