Certain people believe that watching sport programs on TV or visiting sport matches, competitions, and other different sport events not as sportsmen is useless. This opinion has some negative and positive sides, that will be show in this essay.
Firstly, visiting sport events and even watching some competitions on TV is a wonderful way to support some sportsmen and teams. Competitors get a big amount of energy when they know that a plenty of spectators watch the competition and want their favorite sportsmen to win. For example, it is known that hockey or football teams win more often when they play in hometown.
Secondly, watching sport programs or sport events is a popular kind of hobby and have the same benefits as a big range of other hobbies. Observing sport events is a good basis for meeting new people, who can become friend, and many different creative activities, for example people who love sport games sometimes make interesting posters to support their team.
On the other hand, watching sport do not have physical benefits and even can be unhealthy because people just sit on a chair or a sofa and do not move. Some sport games and competitions can be shown several hours, that is far more than an ordinary film, for example. Not moving such a big number of hours can lead to problems with legs and back.
Overall, watching sport has some advantages, such as team support and a big amount of positive emotions, many new friends and motivation for creation, but, at the same time, watching sport programs on TV and other sport events is not good for health and can lead to physical problems. In my opinion, watching sport has more positive sides than negative ones and I claim that it is not a waste of time.
