Wathcing sport competitions is considered to be a bad way to spend time. However, I disagree with this opinion and I believe that attending or watchig sports events is a good hobby which has several positive sides. In this essay the reasons for my view will be discussed.
Firstly, many people have such hobby because it is interesting to gaze at the competition and to make predictions. The spectators hope that their favourite team or sportsman will win, but nobody knows it exactly. Moreover, there are companies where spectators can bet and win money. To illustrate this, my friend, a huge football fan, did a successful sports forecast during the World Football Championship and won thousands of rubles. So, the interest in sports can bring not only joy, but also cash.
Secondly, watchig sport competitions is an inspiration to do sports. Usually people who watch sports events are also amateurs in sport or they are involved in sport after being fans of it. For example, a person who is interested in swimming championships can be encouraged to do swimming, because the person loves the beauty of this kind of sport and already knows many information about it such as the rules of swimming and the approaches to training. This thing is important because doing sports can positively influence individual's health. That can help people stay in a good shape.
To conclude, watching sport events is a way to earn money and an inspiration to start doing sport which means keeping fit. That is why this is not a waste of time.
