in nowadays the problem of waste of time to watching sport evenst on TV or in realitty become more and more popular. People have two different opinions about this problem. the first group of people think that watching sport is the empty spending time ane useless activity. Others say that it is good.
As for my opinion, I think thait watching sports is a good idea. firstly, a lot of people can have an interest to many kinds of sport like a football, hockey, boxing and other. So this people want to watch the TV with a football after their work to relax. Secondly, watching sports men or women can want to do sport by theirself. For example my friend watched the competitions for bodybuilding and got a great form by theirself. Finally, watching sports in a reallity is a great spending time because you acn get enjoy from footbal or hockey playing.
What about the second position, people with this opinion say that watching sports is the waste of time. Firstly, people spend a lot of time near the TV and watching the football but they can spend this time in a gym, working by theirselves. What is more, wathing the football on TV or on studium in reallity, people can become agressive football funs.
I understand this position but desagree with it, because, firstly, watching sports on TV is better relax than going to pub and dring alcohol because relaxing at home we can spend more time with a families. Moreover, going to studium, you can stay on the distance from agressive funs.
In conclusion we can say that watching sports on TV or in reallity is a good way to spend time and relax.
