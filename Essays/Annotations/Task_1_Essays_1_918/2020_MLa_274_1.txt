The graph shows difference in motivation for using Facebook and different ways to use it between men and women. The main trend is that women are much more involved in more different kinds of activities on Facebook rather than man.
The other trend is that people started giving their preference to mobile version of Facebook app. Despite the fact that there is no significant difference in the use of desktop version in period from march 2012 to march 2013, the use of Facebook from mobile devices increased almost twice, from 50 to 100 million users. The loss of users for desktop version is about 10 million. However, we can assume that the entire number of users has grown in this one-year period.
The gender differences for reasoning of using Facebook is also significant. The only thing that both men and women consider the main reason for using Facebook is receiving updates. It is the most popular answer among men, sharing it's place with sending videos and photos. Second reason is also the most popular reason for women. More than a half of women respondents have chosen this as a main reason for using Facebook. The least popular motivation for using this social network is learning about ways to help others.
Summing up, the way people are using Facebook has totally changed in period of time from 2012 to 2013. The gender difference also exists, but it is not definitelly high, so I assume both men and women are using Facebook for almost the same reasons.
