In contemporary world, a lot of people think, that persons who like watching sport on stadiums or TV just waste their time. I am disagree with this position. First of all, becasue sport makes people near to each other. For example, i like football. This is kind of sport that very interesting for me since my childhood. I spend a lot of time with my dad at the our favourite team home stadium. It was very important time of my childhood because at the football events we become friends with my dad. Today i still watching football with my friends, it makes our friendship stornger.
Secondly, sport is important part of international relationship, it makes peace between countries, nations and peoples. For example, at the World War I, german and french soldier had a football match between them in X-mas evening. They stop killing themselves for one night to play football. I think, that it saves a lot of lives.
Finally, watching sport motivate us to do it. When we see strong healthy people we want to be the same. A lot of people going to the gym or another places where they can do sport because they want to be healthy like professional sportsmen. This point motivates me to play football at the weekend because this is good for my health. I think, that i would not play football if i do not like to watch it.
All things considered, watching sport is not useless kind of time spending. A lot of people from all of the world become near to each other becuse sport connect them. Sports events is very useful for people communication and this is great feature of it.
