Many people think that watching sports is a good event, whit out dependence from type of this watching, but other do not agree. I believe that sport is not so interesting type for a spending time. Let's consider some arguments in support of my opinion.
Firstly one can say that sport play a great role in people's lives but sport and fitness should make people healthy. However, when people watch sport, for example football on TV or in a sport-club, or sport-bar, they eat and drink something and do nothing. I think than when people watch sport they just kill time. Secondly, in modern world there are so many types of events, so many interesting things that sport is very boring for a lot of people. In last argument I can say that now we have so many types of sport that many people do not know what can be interesting and what there can choose.
But let's consider this situation on the other hand. Many people are really fans of sport. This people absolutely love watching sport. For this people sport is a hobby, so they believe that watching sport is a very good idea to a spending a time. I think that this opinion also has right to exist.
To draw a conclusion one can say that all people are different. All people can spend this time how they want. All people have variously hobby and minds. When one part of people do not like sport, other part really love watching sport. It is a normal in modern world, when all people are free to choose hobby.
