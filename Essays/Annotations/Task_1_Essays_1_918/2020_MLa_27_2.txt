There is an opinion that watching sports is time consuming and is not an efficient way to spend one's free time. This essay disagrees with such a statement and argues that sport event is very joyful method to relax and have fun with friends.
To start with, if a person is interested in some sport, he/she will dive into watching a competition and will get a ton of emotions. Such a method to spend a weekend is exciting. One can invite friends to have fun together. Sport event also unites a lot of people, who might be from very different countries. For instance, I remeber the football world cup, which took place in Russia in 2018. There were so many people from Africa, Latin America and other further countries, who came in Russia to support their teams. That was very memorable and the feelings were amazing.
Another thing is that regular watching some sport event can defenitely inspire an individual to start doing this kind of sport. It will make him/her be fit and also will have a positive effect on person's stamina. For example, once I started to do equestrian sport thanks to You Tube channels, where one can watch showjumping events online (showjumping - is a kind of equestrian sport, where you should jump over the obstacles on your horse). This activity makes me happy and healthy and also allows me to find very nice people.
To sum up, there is nothing bad in watching sport events. It is an activity, which unites unfamiliar people from the different parts of the world. That is also an amusant way to spent free time with friends or relatives; and the last is that it makes people happy and healthy.
