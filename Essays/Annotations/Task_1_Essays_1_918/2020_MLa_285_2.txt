is it often argued that watching sports is useless. i completly disagree with this opinion and think that sport is good even if you only watching it.
firstly, for some people watching sports bring happiness in their life. cheering with the funclub for the favorite team or for the favorite sportsmen make people feel that they surrounding by common people. for example. I really like figure skating. and in the last year me and my sister sofiia came to Korea for the championship (as fans) betwen juniors. we really were obessed with the one figure skaters - his name is Park Sunghoon. we were surrounding by fans all over the world which cheering for sunghoon with me and my sister sofia. it was an unforgetable experienced. sometimes it makes you not feel alone in your interests.
Secondly, watching sports keeps people motivated. when you see how great sportsmen shape, you just can't ignore it. sportsmen motivate people to look healther. my friend monica was fat - she really liked fastfood. onse she saw Park Sunghoon -figure skater. Monica said that hi is looking like a god, so thats why she decided to lose weight - to became more skinny and elegant like Park Sunghoon. motivation is one the most mportant thing in our life, and it is great when people make you to take care of your health.
to conclude, it is important to say that people shouldn't judge others because of their interests in watcging sports. first of all sport is kind of enviroment. and enviroments makes people happy and motivated to became happy. so, i want to say that watching sports it is good not only for your physical health, it's also great for your mental health.
