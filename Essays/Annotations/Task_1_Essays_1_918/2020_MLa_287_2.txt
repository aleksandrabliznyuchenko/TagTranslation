Moreover, British scientists have proven that games develop our strategic thinking, logic and ability to calculate furher moves, which are necessary for good leaders.
On the other hand, many people disagree with the benefits of watching sports. They believe that it is a waste of time, since the viewer does not directly participate in the process, and therefore he or she does not receive any benefit or improve skills. Opponents also argue that such games induce a person to aggression and fanaticism, which sweep away everything on their way, making a person more morally unstable and ready to give the last money to their favouritepastime. Overall, it is true to say that there is no overwhelming arguments in favor of this question. On the whole, it is great if a person enjoys a hobby, which is vital in our stressful routine.
