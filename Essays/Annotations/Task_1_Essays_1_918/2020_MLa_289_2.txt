It is well known that many people watch sports in their free time, but others tend to think that it is a waste of time. I disagree with this statement and here I will explain why.
Watching sports in your free time has some advantages. Firstly, for some people it could serve as a motivation to start practicing this type of sport by themselves. This might be a chance for them to learn something new from the players as a spectator and then use it on their own. Secondly, watching sports could help to relieve stress and your worries, if that is what you enjoy. There is no shame in spending time on something you like. The time that someone spent on sports would have been spent on their other fun hobbies anyways, so there is no significant difference in choosing your way to rest and enjoy whatever you life. On the other hand, watching sports may involve some disadvantages. For example, it can negatively affect your personal life. People may become so obsessed with sport that it will replace all other important things in life. As any other hobby that went too far, it can lead to an isolation of a person from society. Eventually they will lose themselves in this hobby and ignore their friends and family.
In conclusion, watching sport in your spare time could be a great experience and a great form of entertainment, but for some people it may cause problems in their personal life, so as for everything else you need a balance between your hobby and other important things.
