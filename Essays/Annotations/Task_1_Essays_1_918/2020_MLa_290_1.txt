The bar charts show the Facebook users' changes in the period from 2012 to 2013 and the principles why males and females use this social network. The first picture presents the comparison of using Facebook in 2012 and 2013, while the second depicts the reasons of installing this program for future users.
Overall, it is obvious that people in 2013 started using this social network more often via mobile phones than on 2012. Moreover, the most popular reason for women to surf Facebook is a desire to download media files for other users.
Such increase in using Facebook via cell phones can be explained by the improvement of technological progress. Mobile phones become more comfortable for consumers and, hence, the process of using social networks is less complicated.
The clearest feature of the second chart is a strong wish of female to share photos or videos within this social network. This is the way how "weak" gender can express its creativity and lifestyle and get feedback from other users.
