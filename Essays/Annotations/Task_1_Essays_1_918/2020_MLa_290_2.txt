Nowadays a big part of society claims that a process of watching sports via TV or in stadiums/other places is just a method of useless spending time. This essay cannot agree with this statement.
First of all, people can support their favorite team or friends who play different kinds of sports. This help is very necessary in human relationships, because this is the way how people can express their love, care and attention to each other. Sometimes such kind of support can inspire to make unbelievable things and win the most complicated matches. This is the reason why presence on live competitions is very crucial for players.
Moreover, such atmosphere of watching sports with the help of TV or at live events is special and moments of favorite team's victory visitors can cherish forever. Such occasions are unforgettable and emotions sometimes cannot be translated to other people who were absent in these situations. For instance, the historical Olympiad in the USSR many ancestors still remember and often tell younger generations stories, which are connected with this great and breathtaking event.
To conclude, it is very important to visit or watch on TV in real time such sports events for many reasons. Firstly, the players get so big support and inspiration which help them to cope with all difficulties and become winners. In addition, visitors are in a big flood of energy, emotions and adrenaline which charge them in a positive manner and this "river" becomes a fundament of such pleasant memories. That is why this essay totally disagree with the statement above.
