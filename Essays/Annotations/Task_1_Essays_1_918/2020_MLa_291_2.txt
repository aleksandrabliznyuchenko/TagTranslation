ther is an opinion in socciety, that wathcing any kind of sport activity is just useless spending the time. I can't agree with such statement for the following reasons.
At first, we can't judge other people if they spend their time the way they like. Wathcing sports does not hurt anyone, they do not disturbing other, so whay does we can say anything against it. Futhermore, when sport fans wathicng sports on TV on at live sport events, this is a kinf of therapy for them. They can just spend time with some friends, make fun and rest from working routine. For example, if man just visit football play and he get exhilirated after it, this is surely not useless way to spend his time. Secondly, watching for other's sport succes sometime encourage people start doing some sport. And my own expirience proff that statement. When I was a child I wathced box record on TV, and it was just amazing fight. This record incited me to ask my parent to futher me in my physical education. Thogether we found a great boxing hall near our home, and from that day I am just obsessed with sport.
To sum up, i want to emphasise, that socciety should not just claim other poeople for doing some things, that seems useless for other. If we will treat people this way, we will start to demand usefuleness in every action, life well become boring and unattractive. Everyone can do whatever he like, and if he really like it, no one can call it "wasting of time".
