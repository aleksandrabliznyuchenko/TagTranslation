Sport is an integral part of our lives since ancient times. All sport funs are devided into two groups: those who prefer phisical activities and those who are spectators. I am convinced that watching sports is imprtant for people, opponents say that without active moves sport is meaningless and watching sports is a waste of time. The time you spend watching sports at events is a greate time. What is the difference between cultural valu of watching films or sports? Studing the rules of the particular sport you get new information which you can apply in practise. Moreover, you develop your logic. All live sports events have is a great experience of being the part of social group. Fans have their own customs and decals. Human has social nature, it is vital for us to be in various social groups.
The main goal of sports is phisical activity as the oppnents say. We can not deny the meaning of this point but it is not the single one. Despite the health impact, sports give us mental pluses. Spectators of sports experiense the whole spectrum of emotions during the matches. It gives them chance to add feelings in their ordinary lives.
All people need to have leasure time. Some of us prefer to chill by watching people plaing football or chess. It is not a waste of time. Watching different strategy, your favorite teams, rejoice winnings is a good way to relieve the stress.
To sum up, the meaning of sports consists ont only in running, jumping ect. It gives people much more then only phisical aspect. That is why oppinion about uselessness of spectator sports is not relevant.
