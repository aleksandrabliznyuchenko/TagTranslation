The first bar chart gives information about the number of people in millions using mobile and desktop versions of Facebook over a period of a year between March 2012 and March 2013, while the second bar chart provides the percentage of people divided on a gender basis, who use Facebook due to the following reasons.
It can be concluded from the bar charts that there was no a dramatic change in a number of people using both suppliers (desktop and phone) and that the reasons why both genders use Facebook are mostly the same, however, there could be noticed that women are more inclined to use Facebook for multiple reasons.
To begin, in 2012 the proportion of people using desktop was more than twice higher than those whose took the mobile and was presented in about 150 and 60 millions, respectively. However, in 2013 both numbers means of Facebook usage changed and had opposite directions. The number of people using desktop declined to approximately 130 millions, at the same time mobile usages resulted in a higher levelling up reaching about 100 millions of usages.
Women are mostly guided to use Facebook by such reasons as sharing photos and videos and seeing funny posts (54 and 43%, respectively), while men used it to share photos as well and to recieve updated (both categories resulted in 39 per cent).
