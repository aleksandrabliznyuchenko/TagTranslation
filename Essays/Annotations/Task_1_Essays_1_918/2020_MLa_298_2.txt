Nowadays there is an opinion, that people, who are highly interested in watching sports, especially fans of any type of it, just lose a lot of time on it. The author of this essay fully disagrees with this statement. This is essay will discuss, why is that activity a positive and useful doing.
Firstly it must been said, that people who do sport professionally are always needing an emotional support. This means, that no one of them would like to perform only for himself and his opponent, such situation would reduce they idea of professional sport. For example in conditions of quarantine measures, implemented to stop COVID-19 in this year, the results of some football teams, those always seeked a huge support by their fan-clubs, have always been worse.
