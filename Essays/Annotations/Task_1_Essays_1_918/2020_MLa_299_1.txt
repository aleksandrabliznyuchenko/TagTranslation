The charts illustrate the use of devices between 2012 and 2013 and the reasons to browse Facebook among men and women.
While in 2012 it was more convinient to use Facebook on the desktops, it changed in 2013 with a difference of 40 millions of users that started using their phones. However it is significant to mention that even though desktops have lost their valuability a little, still a majority of population preferes it to using Facebooks on their phones.
it is clear that there are some differences in reasoning for using Facebook between men and women. The most common reason for women is sharing photos and videos while for men there are two equaly common reasons: receiving updates and sharing photos and videos as well. Learning about ways to help others seems to be the least significant reason for both genders with only 35% of women and 25% of men.
To sum up, the main correlation within these charts is in the fact that it is quite comfortable and easy to use a desktop in order to upload pictures and videos on Facebook.
