The question of whether watching sports is a waste of time is a very controversial issue and now it is a matter of considerable public concern. There are, therefore, are people on both sides of the argument who have feelings either for or against. But I totally argee with people who claim that watching sports is just wasting of time. Firstly, people do not learn something new from whaching TV or real-life games. Consequently, it is just a kind of entertainment. In my opinion, if a person receive no new information like a knowledge of fundamental theories about our world structure or some math rules, it will be time spended without profit.
Another reason why I believe that watching sport is a waste of time is an considerable amount of time that people spend commuting to the stadium or sport field. In other words, observers could spend many hours in various maens of transport. For instance, a person may go to by train, because he or she lives in another region of a country. Also after that, it could be neccessary to go to the stadium by bus.
To sum up, there are several causes why I think that males and females watching sport events just lose their time. Personally, I absolutely agree with people who suppose that watching sport competitions is losing of time.
