The bar graph illustrates the use of Facebook in 2012-2013. It is noticable that more people use their desktops to surf this social network.
In March of 2012 the amount of desktop users was at 150 millions, but has decreased till about 140 millions by March of 2013. Also we can see that the usage of mobiles has grown from nearly 60 millions to almost 100 millions. That shows that there is a strong trend that more and more users change the way they utilize Facebook from desktop to mobile. On the second graphic we can see that more women than men are using Facebook to share photos and videos, see funny posts and to learn aboutt ways to help others, whereas the index of 'receiving updates' is on the same level by both groups.
To sum up, Facebook is more popular between female desktop users by the time the graphic is made but it is going to be more populat between female mobile users soon.
