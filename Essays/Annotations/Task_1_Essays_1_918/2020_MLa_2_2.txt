According to some people, watching sport (no matter the way) is just killing of time. However, i disagree with the statement as in my opinion it has many a lot of benefits at all and can be a useful activity.
To begin with, it is important to say that watching sport in leisure time can teach you such things as team spirit and cooperation. Sports teams exhibit a tremendous level of team spirit that you can apply in your daily life. Also, while watching the game, we can gain a large knowledge about it. Moreover, watching sports with our relatives is a great chance to spend some quality time with them. By the way, cheering together for our favorite team gets us closer to each other. Hence, watching sports offers many benefits that are much needed in every sphere of life. Lovers of sport usually have the role model that is built by some sportsman that fascinates them the most. Somebody tries to copy such sportsmen and follow them by keeping fit and adopting healthy lifestyle. Others get so inspired that they choose sports as their career. A lot of football players, for example, were inspired in their childhood by famous players of that time so they have choosen the path of sport and became famous all over the world. There are many stories where sport has inspired people to do things that they were thinking are impossible.
In conclusion, watching sport in free time is a good way of spending leasure time and also a motivation for some people if not to choose it as a career but to change themselves and become more fit. Thats why parents should encourage their children to develop their interest in sport by watching it and participating in it when it is possible.
