Due to the high level of technological and infrastructural development, nowadays sport lovers can easily watch any sports broadcast from anywhere in the world via Internet or on TV and without any promblem have an access to live match. However, the significant number of people believe that the watching sport is a bad way to spend leisure time. In my opinion, a sport game or competition can be both good TV content and an exciting event.
It shoul be noted that, in fact, sport may seem to be useless for the majority of us. The main reason is that person do not get some new knowledge or useful information. Moreover, there are many great alternatives, that are much more useful for our personal development. For example, we can watch and educational TV shows instead of a sport event. Going to the museum or a theatre is a good alternative to the spending time on watching sport. Furthermore, many people think that watching professional sport distract people from sport in real life. But still, watching sport have some crucial benefits, which do not allow me to agree with th opinion that wathching sport is just a waste of time. Firstly, sport game or competition can be very exciting. You have a great chance to get incredible emotions during a game, especially, when you support a concrete team or a certain sportsman. Another thing worth mentioning, that a joint viewing of a match can be a bonding factor for a company of friends. Sport event is a great opportunity to spend time in the circle of close friends.
To sum everything up, in my personal opinion watching sport is not a waste of time, although the potential negative impact. I convinced that watching sport is one of tme most pleasant pastime with your friends.
