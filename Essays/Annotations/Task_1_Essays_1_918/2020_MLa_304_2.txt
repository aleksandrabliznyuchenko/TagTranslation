Many people think that watching sports cannot be considered as useful activity. Personally, I cannot agree with this opinion for several reasons.
To start with, watching sports on TV or at live sports events can be extremely inspiring. Sometimes sportsmen do unbelievable things, something that we could think of as impossible like running 100 meters in 2 seconds or showing difficult elements during figure skating which can blow people's minds. When people see that these athletes or figure skaters are the same as them, they start understanding that there is almost nothing that can stop them from reaching their goals. So, that is the reason why watching sports in any form can be helpful in raising person's motivation.
Also, watching sports is an activity during which a person can relax and have a rest after the hard day. It is the period of time when he or she can leave all problems aside and just enjoy the football game or any other type of sport. Watching sports can reduce stress as a person does something he or she prefers without any pressure. If people start doing only those things which considered useful and meaningful that can lead to burning out and mental illnesses such as depression because lack of rest and relaxation have bad effects on organism. There is literally no reason to think that resting in form of watching sports is a waste of time due to these factors.
In conclusion, it is important to say that watching sports have a lot of advantages like showing people motivation to reach their goals and giving a chance to relax a little bit or forget about their problems. That is why I do not think that it is complete waste of time.
