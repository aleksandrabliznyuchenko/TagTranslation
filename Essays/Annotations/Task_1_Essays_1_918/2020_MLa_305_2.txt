Many people believe that watching videos about sport is not the best way to spend free time. The following essay agree with this point of view for several reasons.
Above all, watching many TV/internet programmes in particular about sport may harm human's health. A government reported showed that a lot of people suffer from obesity and eye diseases because of spending time on sport videos. When person sit in front of the TV or computer he is not active and his eyes in tension. It can become a reason for serious health problems. For instance, my grandfather has to use glasses by reason of watching football games on the TV.
Turning to the second reason, the benefit of doing sports is more than of watching sports. If person has spare time to watch sport events than he has time to be a participant of football, hockey or voleyball team. Moreover, doing sport has excellent impact on human health. Sport develops muscle corset and endurance. To illustrate this point, all of olympic champions have toned bodies, good cardiovascular system and clear skin.
To conclude, people may find better ways to spend leisure than watching sports. Spending life on supervising sport games may be wasting of time without benefits for health. In my view, it is not useful and pleasant variant to pass the time because there are many different abilities to have fun. Furthermore, while sitting in front of the TV quality of body will get worse and muscles will deterioate.
