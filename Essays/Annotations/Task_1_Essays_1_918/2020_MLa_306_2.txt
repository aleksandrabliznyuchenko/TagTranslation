Watching sports is a popular hobby for people of all ages. While some people claim it is the best way of spending time, other disagree saying it is just wasting time for no reason. I disagree that it is a waste of time. From my point of view, watching sports on TV or live is a good way of spending time with friends or relatives.
Firstly, sports always give us memorable experience. I consider that trying something new is always a good idea, so if there is an opportunity to go on a sport event or watch some football match with friends, we should definetly go for it and feel anger, sadness or hapiness for our favourite team.
Secondly, for some people sport may be a part of their job, their permanent hobby, etc. For instance, for photographers or bookmakers or ex-sportsmen. It is all their life, so it is rather disrespectfull to say it is a waste of time. Moreover, it gives an opportunity to relax and forget about every day problems, because the game grabs all the attention.
On the other hand, people can disagree considering watching games is very time-consuming and sometimes it becomes a self-destructive hobby. Some fans are so fond of their team so they act agressively and spend almost all their time watching sports, forgetting about their job, family.
To sum up, although watching sports is a good hobby that gives unforgettable experience, there are still some drawbacks. Everything is good than it is in the right time and in the right quantity. I strongly believe that watching sports really can be an effective way to relax and enjoy your free time.
