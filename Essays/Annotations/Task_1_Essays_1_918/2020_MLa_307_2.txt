There is on opinion that time spent watching sports is wasted. This essay only partly agrees with such a statement, providing agruments for and agains this statement.
To begin with, one of the reasons why such way of spending leisure time may be regarded as insufficient is because of the heakth aspect. While watching life events people tend to sit motionlesslly on the tribunes of several hours or lay on the couch at home if watching TV translation. Moreover, some viewers are becomitg too involved in supporting their team, hence their reaction may occur more emotional. My neighbour is a prime example of such behaviour. During match translalation I often hear him spcreaming and shouting and if his team looses, he is turning into a home tyrant for his family.
On the other hand, watching sports contain multple benefits. It can be quite an entertaineng and stimulating way to spend leisure time with your close ones. What is more, statisics show that watching sport events encourage spectators to start doing one. At the time of Winter Olimpic Games 2014 in Sochi my brother was mesmerized bu speed skators. Six years leater he participates in national competition and is going to pusrue his goals on this path, which started from enjoying that sport event.
In conclusion it is essential to note that such an acute topic as watching sports inevitably causes borth positive and negative reactions, and the way one percieves it is the matter of a person's attitude towards the subject.
