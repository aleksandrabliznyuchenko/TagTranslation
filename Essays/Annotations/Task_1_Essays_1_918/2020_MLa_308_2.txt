Nowdays there is popular public opinion that wathing of different sport events is useless way of spending free time. I can not fully agree on this opinion.
Firstly, I am confident in opinion that most of sport events are rather exciting and fascinating to see because they have some type of plot and drama, so wathing at important football or hockey matches, for example, is not less interesting than watching new drama or action film in the cinema at Friday evening. A lot of people have some kind of hobby in watching important competitons from home or live. Also, we can say that watching sport events is a very helpfull way to know more about different sports, understand their rules and, maybe, start to practice some of them by ourselves. I guess that most of kids playing football in different sportschools or training centres started their way from watching football matches with their parents or friends.
After all, in my opinion every person should have some time to just relax and escape from daily routine for one or two hours after hard working day. Watching sport competitions on TV or sitting on the stadium can be relevant and very helpful measure for such situation.
On the other hand, there are some people who spend several hors a day watching different sport competitions and do not do their house chores. This type of viewers c usually drink alcohol while watching these games and get no self-progress in any sport. For such people it is just a waste of time. To conclude, I can not totally agree with this popular statement and consider that this type if spending free time is not worse than any other type of hobby.
