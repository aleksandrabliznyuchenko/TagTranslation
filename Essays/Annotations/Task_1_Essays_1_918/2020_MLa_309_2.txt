There is an opinion that spend time in way of watchining sport events is useless. I partly agree with this point of view, because sport event have both positive and negative effects. People prefer to relax in different ways: active or passive. All depends on special preferences of a person.
People with active work prefer to relax passive. For instance, if a man or a women have active job - maybe fitness coach or courer they would prefer to have not so active spending time and wach sports on TV or at live sports events. Specially fitness coaches or some professional sportmans enjoy to watch how their colleegs present their sport skills. Nevertheless, other people also prefer watch sport event because it interesting for them. For instance, such tipes of sport as hockey or footbal can make people sensitive and feels nervous. For example, football funs sometimes can be agressive, but in my opinion nowadays it is not actual problem, because people more rational. So, it is great for people with active job and to feel some emotions.
People that have static work shoud spend free time in active way. In my opinion, if the person sit all day and work on computer, it is better for him to not watching sport competitions, but take part in. As for me, the best type to relax - change activity. Also, it has positive influence on health and mind. Definetelly, there are some days when people have not any oportunity to make some sport. Maybe, in such situations it is possible to watch sport competitions to motivate. So, for people with static job it is better to participate in sport events.
To conclude, type of time spending depend on people preferences and types of works - some people enjoy watch sport, others do.
