Some people thing that enjoing sports is a dump of your time. Now I will give my opinion about this.
I disagree with this point of view. Watching sports can help you to kiil your time, can give you motivation to become more athlectic. Perhaps, it is not only a waste of time. At first, watching sports can be a timekiller. If you are in queue, you waste your time. But you can spend it with enjoyment, turn on your phone and open sport stream and you won't see how rapid comes your turn in queue. I will always watch sports when I ride by underground.
At second, watching sports can be a motivation for you. For example, I read a book "The Star has born" about guy called Tom, who was very illness, depressive, and his father bulls always bull him. One day his father died and after it his mother find new husband. This man want to help Tom and bring him to a hockey match. After watching it Tom wishes to become a proffesional hockey player and after lots years of training he achieve his aim. At third, there are a lot of sport funs, who takes pleasure when they watching their favourite type of sport. For example, I am a football fan and I watch every match, where plays my favourite team: Moscow Rabbits. I suffer when they lose and take a great pleassure when they win. I think that taking impressions is our aim when we spend our freetime. In conclusion, I think that watching sports is one of the most popular and one of the most reliable thing, in cause of timekilling, motivation and all spectrum of feelings and it obviously isn't a waste of time.
