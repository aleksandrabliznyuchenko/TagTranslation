Today Facebook is the one of the most popular social media in the world. Many people use it every day and all people have their own reasons to do it. The questions of this text is what difference in reasons to use Facebook between men and women and what is the most popular platform to do it.
Firstly, I need to say that the most popular platforfm to use Facebook was desktoap in 2012 as it was in 2013. But, to tell the truth, mobile phone become a much more popular in 2013 to compare with 2012. For example, in 2012 only 55 millions of people use mobile phones to use Facebook, while in 2013 almost 100 millions of people use it for search in Facebbok, it is a very big progress in mobile phone popularity.
In my opinion, almost all people have their own reasons to use Facebook but the most popular between men and women is recieving updates, seeing funny posts and sharing photos. In fact, the are some differernce between men and women in Facebook using, for example, there are 15% more women who use facebook to sharing photos and 8% more womans who use Facebook to see funny pictures than men. This difference shows how men and women differ in their interests.
To conclude, Facebaook is now very very popular in our lives but the are many ways and many reasons to use it.
