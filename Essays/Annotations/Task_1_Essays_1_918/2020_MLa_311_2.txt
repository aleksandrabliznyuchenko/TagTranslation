There are a lot of people who enjoy watching sport in real live or on TV, but the others sure that it is just wasting of time. I can't agree with the statement in the topic because such time spending can be productive and important.
So there are a lot of positive effects in watching sport. First of all, it is a good way to relax after hard work days. For example, football fans can meet with their friends on weekends, watch footbal at home or in sport bar and pray for their favorite team. Such common interest can helps to people to interact with each other and to get acquitanted with new mates, what is very important for mental health and self-confidence. Moreover, sport can unite not only fans, but all country and even all the world. The best example of it are the Olympic Games and Mundial. When they were in Russia in 2014 and 2018, there was a significant rise of common sense, of friendship regarding to citizens of other countries and a lot of positive emotions. So sport can unite all people from all over the world.
Secondly, it can be useful to watch sport for improving thinking skills. When you analyse strategy of players or their way of playing, you develop your logic and understanding of game sense. Watching sertain sports can be very useful for sportsmen who play in it and want to improve their analytical and strategy skills. For example, volleyball or hockey player can watch on type of playing in his favourite team and after watching try to use it by himself too.
In conclusion, it is up to everybody, to watch sports or not. But in my opinion, watching sports competition can be a good and useful enough way of relax for people who enjoy it.
