There is an opinion that watching sport by broadcasting or at the stadium is irrational way to spend the time. As for me, I strongly disagree with such a statement and I will show the reasons of such an attitude of mine to this position further in the essay.
The first reason why I do not support the above-mentioned statement is because of personal attitude of individuals to the watching of sport. There are people who are really excited of watching sport, they are the loyal fans of sport teams or sportsmen, and watching sport, especially at the stadium, means for them not only to look at the actions which happen, but also to express their support. The vivid example of such people is the fans of Liverpool Football Club who are famous for the song "You will never walk alone", which they sing as chore of thousands of people in every single game and it sounds incredible.
The second reason of my disagreement with the presented opinion is the existence of educational purpose of watching sport. Both the professional sportsmen and the beginners may leran how to improve their skills or how to use the mistakes of the opponents. For example, there is a great number of children who are being fascinating of how Lionel Messi plays and if there were no opportunity to watch his games it would be harder for them to learn his tricks and a manner of play. Another example is that all the professional football teams do always watch previous games of their following opponents to understand the tactics they have used before, what are the weak points which may be helpful, and for other reasons which provide a chance to win.
To sum up all the ideas, there are enough evidences which prove that watching sport is definitely not a waste of time.
