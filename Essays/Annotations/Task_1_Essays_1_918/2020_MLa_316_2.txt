In other days sport is essential part of human's life. Some people do physical trainings every day, some people are just fans of some kind of sports and they enjoy watching sports on TV. However, there is an opinion that watching sports on TV, in the Internet or at live sports events is just a waste of time. To begin, some people think that watching sports on TV or in the Internet is absolutely useless. First of all, it may cause problems with person's health and also may isolate him from his friends and family. For example, a man is watching football game on TV every day, but his family do not like football and it might lead to conflicts between family members. There also can be a situation that a person will prefer watch TV rather than spend time with friends. There is an opinion that this method of spending time is not very effective and it does not have any advantages.
One more reason why watching sports on TV or live events is a waste of time, is that it is healthier to do some sport or physical exercises rather than watch it. Do sports is much more usefull and effective way to spend someone's free time. By the way, if a person do sports, he or she will be physically fit and do not have problems with heart or overweight, for example.
In coclusion, I disgree that watching sports in TV is a waste of time. There is many objective reasons why people watch sports on TV or at live sports events. For someone it is kind of hobby, which makes them happy.
