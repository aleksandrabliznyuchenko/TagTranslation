Nowadays watching sports on TW or at live sport events is a popular way of leisure activity among people, but some groups of people think that it is a waste of time. I can not fully agree with that statement and I want to describe this opinion in this essay.
Frankly speaking it is difficult to deny, than watching sports without taking part in spot games are useless and unneeded. Visiting live sports events can be very expensive, especially when we speak about popular and important matches. The cost of tickets can be very big and people prefer watching sports at home on TW or use the Internet. But, position about watching TV is not better than position abot visiting sport matches. Everybody knows that TV have bad influence on our helf. Moreover, watching sports on TV replaces people leaving home and acrive recreation. From these point of view watching sports can be seen like a waste of time. Nevertheless, we should mark that there are a lot of advantages in these type of leisure activity. Firstly, there are a lot of sport channels in the all World that have a huge of fans and followers. It shows that watching sports witchout takinin part in it is a big culture for fonds of different sport games. Secondaly, there are a great variety of live blogs in the Internet abou srort, that provise translations for followers. Authors of thrse blogs send followers on matchs and speak abour culture of sport matches. Finally, there are a lot of people witchout enought healh abilities for taking part in sport games by themself, but they love sport and will go for live events no matter what. It is impossible to deny, that watching and visiting sport event is a great culture in modern world. By this way I can not fully agree with position that watching sports on TW and visiting live sports events is a waste of time. In conclusion I want to mark, that any position about that topic can be hearing, bur agree witch opinion that watching sports is a waste of time is very difficult for me.
