Owing the discussion about watching sports, some people consider it as useless activity, while others disagree with this opinion. To my mind, watching sports is a great hobby to have, that develops many personal skills.
The opponents of sport as an entertainment think that it is a waste of time. Even though watching sports is basically sitting on a couch or tribune, there are some qualities a fan should have. Firstly, to enjoy the play one should know the rules of this particular kind of sport which can contain hundreds of norms and standards. Secondly, most of the sports events have element of competition, including various ranks and championships. Being involved in observation of such sports, a person probably develops analysing skills to predict wins ang loses. Thirdly, most kinds of sports are known for the speed of action. That means, that a watcher should have fast reaction on any tiny changes to be able to follow them.
Not to mention, sport fans have great community to share their passion and for human as a social being it is crucial to have such level of support. Therefore, sports can unite people. For instance, my friends connected on a basis of mutual love for soccer and now they are going to marry. Futhermore, any hobby could be named silly and wasteful, so that no one should discriminate others and their interests, that bring them joy and happiness.
To conclude, I do not consider watching sports as a waste of time, because people are free to have any hobby that they like and not to be judged. Additionally, being a fan of some sports develop your brain, analytic skills and rapidity of thinking process and may give one a lot of social connections.
