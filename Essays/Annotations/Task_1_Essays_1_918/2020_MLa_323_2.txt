I agree with opinion, that passion for watcing competitions by tupes of physical culture is not important activity for those, who are not really intersted in that, as me.
For example, you can find more interesting activity for you or your company, as watching films or playing the guitar. There are a lot of things, that can be more useful also, like cooking or doing sport instead of watching it on TV. There is no fun in sitting with company without any pportunity to talk or express thoughts, because there is loud voice from the screen that makes conversation impossible. There is many opportunities to impove slills, instead just setting.
Moreover, for watching competitions as biathlon or football, people need to know all rules and have a well-knowledge in the names of sportsmens or thainers. If you or your company do not know something, you will ned a person that will make sence in all wods of commentator. And this is also waste of opportunity to do something more useful. Maybe this is interesting for someone to sit in front of TV and loudly scream, but not all can find something useful and sencerable in that.
Ergo, such activity as sitting in front of screen and watching how pople running or jumping is not very useful activity when you can waste your time with finding interests not onlu for you, but for your friens. Also, there is opportunity that you can not remember all of the rules and standarts that is needed for understand the situation on TV.
