Some people claim that watching sports on TV or at live sports events is a spending time with no reason. I do not adree with this statement for a several reasons.
To begin with, people relax while watching sports. They usually do it after work or on their weekends, when they have free time. Watching sports helps people to concentrate on something that differs from their daily routine, so they change the activity what is very useful for refreshing. Refreshing is an important thing for working people because when person had a good rest, he or she will work on the next week properly.
What is more, watching sports develops empathy in people and brings them some good emotions. When people support the particular team or sportsman, they feel happy with their success and it brings them joy. When sportsmen get injured supporters feel sorry for them. People cheers the ones that they are support and wish them all the best, even though they may do not know these sportsmen personally. It makes supporters more kind and sympathetic.
On the other hand, while watching sports people do not do anything useful. They just spend time looking after some actions that other people do. It does not gives any benefits for them or their health. That is why i find the opposite point of view considerable.
To sum up, even though the position that watching sports is a waste of time is understandable for me, i do not agree with it. I think that this type of spending time helps people relax and brings them a lot of joy what is very important for people nowadays.
