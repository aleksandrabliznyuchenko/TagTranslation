Some people are thend to think that the process of watching sport proggrams on TV is a waste of time. I can not fully agree with this point of view.
On the one hand, watching some programs on TV may take a lot of time, that could be used in more afficient way. Being so entertained by the pictures that change each other on the TV screen, it is so easy to spend more time watching TV, than you have planned before like training or exersicing. So for some people it is more interesting to play football in real life, than just watching and not to take part. Moreover, nowadays TV become not so popular source of entertainment especially in sport, because you have to wait a long time to watch a play or a match on TV. Sometimes it could be annoying to watch the same matches twice, it is better to use internet to find life streem.
On the other hand, some new platforms like Netflix are invented to raise the number of viewers of TV. Understanding the tastes of majority of people, Netflix are becoming more popular with different age groups. In the result, it is still possible to watch TV and use some platforms to find different content, that include sport content too. It wouldn't be a waste of time, if you always find something new, but in more morden way by watching some programms. At least not all people like to take part in competitons or some sport games, it is more pleasent for them to absorde it. Futhermore, huge numder of people watch TV after a long day at work to relax. Spend some time to get possitive emothions and have a rest, watching some sport matches, is a great way to feel enrgetic again and continue to do more important tasks.
In my opinion, watching TV is a good way to find information about sport and in the center of sport events, even if you have to wait for a while to see it on TV. But in the same time it would be better doing sport in real life, not watching it on TV.
