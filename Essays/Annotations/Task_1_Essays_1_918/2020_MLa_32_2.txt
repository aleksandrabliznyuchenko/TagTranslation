Over the last half century people become busier, get more work volume, stress and have less time for rest, relaxation. But do not value their free time and waste it watching TV or sports, meanwhile there are a lot of other kinds of helpful rest.
I would like to begin by saying that we always should seek ways to get quality rest for restoring our energy, for example it maybe massage session, playing of football or strikeball with friends, reading books about self-development and analyzing your personality, drinking a cup of tea with parents in a forest, walking in the neighboring town, going to the sauna and etc. And I think when you sit in your comfortable armchair, it is not helpful for your body, your health and your energy reserve decreases. The second negative moment is that it is difficult to stop watching TV and sometimes you do not sight that the whole evening passed by sitting in front of the TV. Also often we worry about our team, we become sad if our favourite team loses and it may has a negative impact on the relationship with close people.
I want to notice that whatching sports somitimes can be good choice. When you watch at live sports events. For example if you go to stadium for watching football match it is really helpful way to restore energy, to clean brain from thoughts.
In conclusion, I tend to think that watching sports is not very good way to spend time, but someimes it can be very helpful for us.
