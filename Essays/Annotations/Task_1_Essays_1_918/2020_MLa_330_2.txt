It is widely discussed that someone who is watching sport programms completely lose their time that they can spend for another productive activities. I am completlely disagree with this statement, cause in my opininon sport programmes have some advantages.
To start with, the sport programmes extend the scope of knowledge among the people of all ages. When people watch football, basketball or track and field competitions, they can find a lot of new information about the rules, game construction and types of different exercises. This information can intent the people to learn more about physical education, to share this information with each other and to explore the world.
Secondly, sport programmes can become the reason for the motivation to be in the healthy and strong. For example, when the young boysees the popular, strong and fast football or basketball player, he actually becomes a fan and he wants to be like him. As the result, he starts to do different sport exercises like jogging, functional and strenghth training. Later, he begins to go to the gym and different sport clubs and tries to obey the rules of the healthy lifestyle.
Finally, with the help of watching sports, people can get useful skills such as teamwork or tactic management. When people of all ages watch the good team cooperation during the football or hockey match and how the planning of the strategy can be useful for the victory, the watchers can take and learn some skills for the survival in the daily routine. To sum up, despite that some people consider that watching any sports is harmful, this activity can bring a lot of benefits, such as the increasing of the number of people with helathy lifestyle.
