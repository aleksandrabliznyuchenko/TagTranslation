There is a popular point of view that watching sports is a waste of time. I totally disagree with this opinion because this activity can help people in different spheres of life. First, watching sports causes a great amount of positive emotions to the spectator. It is difficult to describe that feelings, that are given to the supporter of the winning team or an athlete. There is no doubt, that all emotions stay with this fan for few days after the sport event. It makes a great impact on supporter's life and increases of his overall level of happiness.
Second, watching sports provides a unique opportunity to communicate with people from different countries. The language of sports is clear for everyone that is why it is easy to feel the same emotions like the person from the different part of the world. A lot of tournaments are hosted by Russian Federation and it costs nothing to make new contacts.
Third, people should not underestimate the effect of visualization. It is widely known, that watching how someone is doing something extremely perfect helps do the same thing better later. I am absolutely sure that this rule works in sports too. Of course, simple watching cannot substitute practicing but might be the right choice as the bonus for practicing itself.
In conclusion, watching sports definitely has its benefits and it is not correct to call it "a waste of time". It helps to get strong positive emotions, communicate with interesting people from all over the world and improve the level of doing sports.
