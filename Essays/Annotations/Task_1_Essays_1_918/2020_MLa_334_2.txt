Many supports the view that watching people playing sport is pointless, because it distracts people. A completely disagree with this opinion for two reasons: watching sport competitions can help to relax after difficult day and sport events can motivate people for healthy lifestyle.
Firstly, visiting sport events and watching sport programs on TV is a good leisure activity. Many people need to regenerate and relax after their weekdays, so watching sport can be a good way to do it, because they can spend time with their friends, communicate about their favorite team. For example, my father has a tradition to watch football with his friends every month. He and his friends are getting together, discussing different thing either not related to sport. That is why I think, that watching sport events is a good time spending.
Secondly, sport programs and events can motivate people to become healthy and to do sport. Sportsmen can be idols for many people as much as actors or singers, so people have a motivation to look similar as their idol. My brother were obsessed with watching football, when he was a kid. He wanted to be as strong and fast as Cristiano Ronaldo. Now he play footbal regular To conclude, sports can make a good impact on people's lives, since sports helps to relax, socialise with other and motivates people.
