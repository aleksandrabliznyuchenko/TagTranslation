Some people have an opinion, that watching sports are not so useful for people and that's a waste of time. I completely disagree with this opinion, becuase watching sports is one of the best way to improve themselves.
Firstly, if you watching sports, you can compare strategy of different sportsmen and then use the most comfortable strategy. That's a good way to improve yourself and begin to use some new methods to keep fit and win your friends in some sports. However, incorporating watching sports in your timetable can take some time, that you can spend on practice. But watching sports is very important for doing sports people. They learn new techniques and acquire new skills that they can use in competition through watching some sports.
Another point to consider watching sports are not waste of time is that watching sports will probably result in people developing in interest in do sports. In other words watching sports engages people in sports. When a person watches sports, he understands how interesting sports can be. A person understands that his type of acticity has a positive effect on his health and on his fit. Then the person get involved in a process of doing sports.
To sum up, to deal with an increasing amount of unfit and overweight people, we need to advertise sports. Watching sports helps us to do it. Watching sports helps not only ordinary people to get involved in sports, but also it helps athletic people trying to improve themselves. That is why watching sport isn't a waste of time.
