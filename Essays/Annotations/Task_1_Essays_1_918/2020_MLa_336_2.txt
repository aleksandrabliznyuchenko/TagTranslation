There is an opinion that watching sport activities is pointless. I completely disagree with this opinion for certain sufficient reasons.
Firstly, sports motivate people: viewers desire to be as physically well and beautiful as the athlets, this helps the viewers to develop healthy habits and to do sports themselves, which is undoubtably beneficial for their organisms. Watching sports can even motivate a person to start his/her own sport career. The history is full of such examples when a professional sportsmen were inspired by older, more famous athlets to actually start their career. For example, a well-known Formula-1 driver, Lewis Hamilton once said that he was given inspiration by Michael Schumacher, another world-famous F-1 driver.
More than that, while watching sport competitions, plenty of people gain a common interest, a topic which they can endlessly discuss with other sport fans. Whether it be the performance of their favorite team in the last game, the performance of a rival team or a particular athlete, fans' prognosis on a future match, race or fight, it is always delightfully pleasant to find a person with the same passion for sports as you have and to chat with such person. Even arguing brings joy, not to mention how fascinating gambling bets could be. It was great to argue, for instance, with my father about whether Habib Nurmagomedov or Conor McGregor would win a championship.
To sum it all up, watching sport competitions, in my opinion, overall has certain benefits and cannot be called pointless whatsoever. It inspires people to implement a more healthy way of life or even begin their own sport career. It also gives people a common interest, which is great for interpersonal communication.
