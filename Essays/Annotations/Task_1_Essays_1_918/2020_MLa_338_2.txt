According to opinions of some people, spending time by watching a particular sport is just killing time. However, I disagree with the statement as in my opinion it is a useful activity and it has many benefits.
To begin with, by watching sports spectators learn several things such as cooperation and team spirit. Sports teams exhibit a tremendous level of team spirit that one can apply in his or her daily life. Also, while watching the game, we can gain immense knowledge about it. Moreover, watching sports with our loved ones is a great opportunity to spend quality time with them. Better still, cheering together for our favourite team brings us closer. Hence, watching sports offers many benefits that are much needed in every sphere of life. Sports lovers often have role models that fascinate them the most. One tries to copy them and follow their secrets to stay fit and ultimately gets benefied by adopting healthy lifestyles. Some of them get inspired and choose sports as their career. For example. modern bodybuilders are inspired of succes of Franco Colombo, who was the icon of the Gold Era of Bodybuilding, and try to be like him. So. there are many stories where a particular sport has inspired people.
In conclusion, watching sports is a good way of spending time and for some people this hobby may even turn into a career. So, people should encourage their children to develop interest in sport by watching it and participating in it whenever possible.
