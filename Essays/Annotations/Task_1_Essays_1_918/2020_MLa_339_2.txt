Nowadays there are a lot of types of sports. Some people do it by themself, while other just watch for them for particular reasons. Personally, I think that everyone can spend their time like they want and it is nothing useless in watching sports.
On the one hand, people say that watching sport is a useless time-spending, because it is better to go for a running or go to the gym for workout and not just sitting and watching TV or live competition. Also, there is a belief that while someone is watching you, you cannot do things right, so "wathers" just distract sportmens and waste their time on it. And of course, these people say that you have nothing to development while watching sports, for example, there is nothing you can learn from curling or golf.
On the other hand, there are people who think that there is nothing wrong in watching sports. For example, while you are watching some competitions you are supporting sportmens, giving them courage, confidence and strength. And these things exactlly help sportments to win tournaments, olympic games, leagues of champions and ext. Moreover, some people are into music or painting or they just could not be succesfull in sports, so they support their friends or country as they just have not got abilities for do it. Also, it is obvious, that sport is really dangerous and people may have some diseases, so ex-sportsmens or ordinary people can only watch their favourite sport because they love it, they receive emothions and adrenalin while wathicng competitions.
To sum up, I stick the opinion that people can watch sports on TV or at live events, because there are a lot of reasons why human cannot do something. So, why people should refuse from watching sports if it brings emothions, adrenaline or even some people want to live.
