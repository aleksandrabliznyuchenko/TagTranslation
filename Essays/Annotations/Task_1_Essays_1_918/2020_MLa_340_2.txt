Some people think that watching sport it's not how you should spent your time. However others believe that watching sport on TV channels or at live can improve their mood. I partly agree with this statement, but I more inclined to believe that it is useful.
In my opinion, watching sport it's necessary in our currently life for two reasons. Firstly it can help throw away your emotions out, because from the ancient times, sport it's not only a sport as such, but also a spectacle. Watching someone masterfully do something can be fascinating in itself. And then there's the confrontation. Also excitement, interest and pleasure. If you like it, if you appreciate it, why give up the pleasure? There aren't many sources of it anyway. Secondly it's not for nothing that so much attention is paid to sport and even separate channels have been created. You often watch it and want to achieve some results too, like famous sporty persons. Sport teaches discipline and patience, and maybe when children watching sports will chose not to go with worst friends, who smoke and use drugs, but to go playing football. Perhaps this will be a boost to bright future. However, you shouldn't act like some sports football fans, who are too match to vent their emotions You should always keep within the bounds of decency.
Another words, watching TV competitions helps to keep bad emotions inside you and throw them in a good direction. Also watching sport, especially, can bring lost of new emotions to your life, make you famous just after you look to currently famous sportsmen. But always remember the framework and doing sports more tan watching.
