Many of people think that spending free time by watching sport and sport events is just killing precious time. I disagree with this statement, because I believe that it is a veru useful and it has lots of benefits.
Firstly, we all know that doing sports is useful, but watching sports broadcasts is not at all. But Australian physiologists are ready to argue with this statement. They found that the same process occur in the bodies of fans as in athletes: the pulse and breathing become faster, sweating increases and blood rushes to the muscles. It turns out that watching sports competition is such a lazy training of the cardiovascular system. And a love of sports improves strategic thinking. American scientists have found that people who regularly watch football matches in life are better at solving strategic problems.
Secondly, sport is a way to splash out the emotions. This was proved by one of the American scientist. He found out in the early 1990s that fans are generally more confident and less prone to depression. Maybe because watching is a kind of therapy? The men in the stands can shout, dance for joy, and even cry and no one will judge them. But it is the emotional closeness of the stronger sex that is considering harmful to the psyche and dangerous to health. It turns out that fans unlike ordinary men, at least while watching marches, get an emotional discharge.
In conclusion it is worth saying that watching sports programs is not a waste of time
