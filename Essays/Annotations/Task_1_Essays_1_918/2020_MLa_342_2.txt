There are the old discussions about watching sports on TV or in live championat. Some people suppose that it is a waste of time and you can do some relevant deals, but others find that of variant of relaxing. In my opinion, the watching sports game can have some place in our socity, but it demands to have some limit. In this essay, I will ague my point of view by some instances.
Firstly, this competitions unite different people in one community and it is good for socity, because national unites is very important for each country. Also on this sports party you can make new friends with same interests or just spend time good. Therefore, if you watch some sports games, you may will want to try this sport and it will be good for your health. For example, than I was younger, I watch a lot of football games and after that I go with my friend to this sport section.
But on the another hand, this hobby can be hurmfull for your health, because sedentary lifestyle can improve some heart desices or obesity which is very serious problems in 21th century. And it is true, that people are drink some alchool products within watching some sports competitions very often. I think that this point is the main disadvatage of watching sports games, because it can improve unhealth addiction.
To sum up, I think that watching sports is not bad, but it can provide some people to the bottom of socity by improving bad addiction. Of course if you do health lifestyle, it will give a lot of happy moments of life.
