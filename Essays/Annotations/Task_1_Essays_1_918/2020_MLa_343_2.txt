Nowadays watching sport is a very popular way to spend time. However, some people think it is a waste of time. In my essay I will analyze the arguments and provide my opinion.
From the early beginning of human civilisations people started watching sport events. The interest to it remaned the same today. On the one hand, for people who like spending their time only effectively assume watching sport events is a complete waste of time. On the other hand, if person is satisfyiad with this way of spending time, enjoyed that and felt happy after, it should not be a problem. In my opinion, watching sport event will not be a waste of time if person truly enjoyed it. Some of sport events are really beautiful and that beauty are made humans for humans and it should exists. For example, figure skating with that incredible dance and wonderful music is a masterpiece. There is nothing bad in doing something legal if you deeply enjoyed it. And watching sport events is not a crime. Only you should know how to spend your own time. Also important to add of the inspiring effect it gives for people. Many good things were created and many will be.
Humanity lives in a complicated world so there is no point of judging of the ways other people spent their own time.
