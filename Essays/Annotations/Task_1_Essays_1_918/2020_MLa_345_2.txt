Nowadays a lot of people suggest that watching sports on TV or at live sports events is a waste of time. As for me, I do not agree with this statement and think that it can be very interesting and exiting.
On the one hand, watching sports events has a lot of pros. Firstly, it can be somebody's hobby and a source of inspiration. He or she can be a fan of some sports team and it is important for him or her to follow the team, it's games and victories. For example, I have a friend which is a fan of a Russian football team and he does not miss any game with this team because he likes it very much. Moreover, for people who are going in for sports it can be beneficial to watch games and analyse the strategy of the team. This I know from my own experience. Several years ago I played basketball and to make my game better I watched some sports channels and went on basketball events. So I support this thesis and think that watching sports is useful for many people.
Contrariwise, there is an opposite opinion that people who watch sports only lose their time. It can be so if these persons are not interested in sports at all. For instance, my mother does not go in any sports and it is boring for her. Because of this she does not understand my father who watch a lot of sport games because he enjoys them.
Taking everything into consideration, I would like to say that both views take place but for me as a person who likes sports watching it on TV or at live events is not a waste of time at all.
