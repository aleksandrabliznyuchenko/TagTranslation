Nowadays, watching sport for some people is just waisting time and there are many more usefull activities to do. In my opinion, watching sport on TV is trully waisting time, because it's more profitable to do sport not to watch.
On the one hand, people who really like sport, spends there time on doing it instead of wathcing. In other words, it's better to practise you skills in some sport rather than watching other people doing it. Furthermore, it's especially important for team sporrts for example hockey, because it also improves peoples communication skills, and it has bigger impact on person, than watching TV alone.
On the other hand, some people are ready to spend hours or even days to visit favourite sport event, which has no reason. Sport events lasts for a long time. Instead of losing the hole day on sport event, people could do some important things, like studying or working. Moreover most of sport events are very expencive, it's not about wasting time, also about wasting money. For instance, some footbal teams have to go to another cities or even countries to play with other teams and mostly loyal fans are ready to spend weeks and thousands of dollars to support them
