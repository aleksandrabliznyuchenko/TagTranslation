Nowadays some people believe, that watching sports events is a waste of time. Of course there are many men, who think else. In this essay I will discuss both views and give my opinion.
First of all, there are all many kinds of sports, which are not only interesting, but also are very intellectual. People watch them to improve their skills, improve their thinking in different aspects of life. The most obvious example of intellectual sport is chess. A lot of people think, that this is not a sport, but it is actually very hard event for sportsman's brain and for his body. When people watching chess not only to kill the time, but with diving in the action mentaly and thinking with both of players they can scignificantly improve their mind.
On the other hand there are many kind of sports which are boring, where the result is not depend of intellectual things, only on physical part of sportsman. For example marathone. There are no doubts, that this is one of the hardest kind of sports in the world. The sportsmen, who take part in it are heroes, maybe even superheroes. But if rationally look at this kind of sport this is only running. And I believe, that watching 3 and a half hours on running people is obvious a waste of time. There are many more useful things, which I prefer to do.
To sum up, there are many different kinds of sports: boring and interesting, stupid and intellectual, but I think watching sports is very good, because it brings so emotional moments to people's lifes, which they will never forget.
