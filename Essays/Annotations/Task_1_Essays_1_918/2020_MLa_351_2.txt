Nowadays lots of people are interested in sport and try to do sport or watch it on TV and support their favourite team. I believe that watching sport is a healthy and useful activity. In this essay I will focus on main arguments to support my point of view.
Many people do sports themselves, some of them do it when they have free time or just to keep fit but for others doing particular kind of sport is a job or they have a clear goal to achieve high level in it. There are also people who can not do sports such as disabled people and the only opportunity they have to feel the atmosphere or pretend the sportmen themselves is watching sports on TV or alive on the stadium. Anyway watching sports is useful as person can learn some skills and habits that professionals have and demonstrate. Major of tennis coaches tell their students to watch big matches participating with tennis star plyers on TV or on the stadiums.
Watching sports makes people happy. After a day at work people come home and can relax and give emotional rest for their brain. Espessialy people who have a favourite team support it on every match, they stress and believe their team would win. So when team wins, its fans are the happiest people in the world. There is a research that proves that people supporting their favourite teams feel more satisfied and happy than people who just watch it or who are not even interested in it at all.
Coming to the conclusion, watching sports is a good and positive hobby and the way of spending time. It is also a good way to relax and give your brain a chance to rest. For young sportmen it is a very nice oppotrunity to see who prifessionals play and learn some skills.
