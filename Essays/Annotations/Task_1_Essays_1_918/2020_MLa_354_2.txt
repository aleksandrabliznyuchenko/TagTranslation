Some people believe that watching sport is just a waste of time, while other think differently. In my viewpoint, it is meaningless to spend free time on watching sports on TV or at live sports events.
The main point is that by watching sports people waste their spare time: as a result, they do not do important and usefull things. First, they do not go in for sport. For example, they cannot find much time to do morning exercises or go jogging, which are quite usefull activities for those who tries to keep fit. Second, those who love watching sports have less time on their family members. For instance, they may find no time on playing with their childreen or even talking to them, because watching sport often takes lots of evening time. It is also important to point out, that because of spending time on watching sports people might experience plenty of negative emotions. First of all, sports fans often feel sad because their favourite teams or individuals lose. For example, they may experience sadness because they believe their sports team will win. Secondly, after watching sports people can become angry. For instance, they may conclude that the game was unfair, so they will blame their opponents.
To sum up, I strongly believe that people should not spend their free time on watching sport, because this is waste of time. Such an activity is neither important nor usefull for individuals.
