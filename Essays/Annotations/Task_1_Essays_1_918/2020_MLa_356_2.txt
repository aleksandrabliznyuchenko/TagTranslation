Some people are convinced that there is no reason to watch sports and it is a waste of time. I slightly agree with this statement, because modern person have a lot of other responsibilities and interests to spend time. Also, you can do some sports by yourself.
Firstly, time is the most significant resource in the modern life. Every single person need to learn something new, gain new skills and increase qualification level to get a well-paid and interesting job. For instance, a typical footlball match length is about 90 minutes. In this time you can do a lot of useful things like watching videocourse, reading a specialized book or writing a code.
Secondly, if you are a sports fan, you can do sports by yourself. It is not obligatory to watch a football match, when you can participate in real football match with your friends or colleagues! It would be more healthy option than sitting in front of TV with some snacks. Furthermore, you can do some exercises on the fresh air to improve your health and become a better human being.
On the other hand, it can be useful to watch sports. If you are an amateur sportsman, for example, a boxer, it is reasonable to watch some pro boxing matches, because you can gain some experience from it, like unique offensive and deffensive techniques.
To sum up, modern people have more important things in their life than just watching sports on TV, because they are tend to work a lot on their self-development. However, sometimes it can be reasonable in practical use.
