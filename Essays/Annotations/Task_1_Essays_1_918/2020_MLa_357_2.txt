There are different opinions in our society concerning sports event whether it is useful or not. Some people think that it is just waste of time and there is nothing good to watch sports. Others believe that watching sports bring much benefits. So, who is right? As far as I am concerned, watching some sport events is good way to spend your free time. Actually, I think that there are lots benefits watching sports. Firstly, we all know that communication with other people is really important fo all the people, and sport provides good chance to watch it on TV or visit live events together with your friend or family. Secondly, watching the successes of sportsmen can motivate people to start doing some sports, too. Obviously, this is really good for health. Finally, watching sports can be just one the ways how to relax after the school, work on anything else like that.
However, there are several arguments for the opposite opinion. First of all, most of sport events are not intelligent at all, thus they cannot promote nothing good and useful to anybody. Furthermore, you have to spend much time to watch sports, whereas you can spend it to something more useful for you like studying, working or cleaning the house. Moreover, in some cases visiting live sport events can be dangerouos if we talk about something like football derby or carting.
In conclusion, I would like to say that despite the fact that there are arguments to both points of view, I still believe that watching sport brings more positive than negative in our lives.
