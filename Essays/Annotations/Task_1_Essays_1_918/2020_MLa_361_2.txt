Some people believe that watching sports on stadium or TV is unnesesary. Personally, I think that sport is very important for people and sometimes you should watch it, but most of people have not time for it.
On the one hand, every person know that sports help to be healthy. I think that every mother in the whole world say it to her children very often. A lot of children go to some sport classes, for instance, dance, tennis, football. As for me, a have studing dance for 10 years, and now I very gladful to my mom for it, because I belive that without dance I will be bad health. Then you do somthing you need to example how you should do this exercise, and you can watch it on TV. Moreover sportsmen shold watch sports too, they can take inspiration before competition.
On the other hand, some people have a lot of tasks and they have not time for sports. I think that they are unhappy, because they shold work all the time. For example, most of parents went live sports events with their children. I think that you can do not love sports, only because you also not find your type of sports.
In conclusion, I want to say that every person should watch sports for anumber of reasons. If you not like sport, ou should try to find that you love.
