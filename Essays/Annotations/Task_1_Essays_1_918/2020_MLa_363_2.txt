Nowadays some people consider that watching sports is a waste of time. In this issue i say my opinion for this topic and arguments for and against.
On the one hand, up-to-date, rapid rhithm of life imposses it is demands and people had to do a lot of things simutaneonsly. However, there are only twenty hours in a day. Therefore, people need to prioritize activities in according with possible benefit from them. What is more, watching sports is wildly supposed to be an entertainment for lazy people and so is wastle of time, as you do not get some profit from it active and rational people prefer to do sports in order to the healthy, but not watch it.
On the other hand, modern world is overwhelmed with stresses and often people need a sort of emotional release. Sport is considered to be a flawless way to chill out even if you just watch it on the TV or life. Moreover, poor people in developing and Third World countries had to tighten their belts so they often can not affroad to play sports. Therefore for them watching sports is the only opportunity to be somehow related to it.
Taking everything into consideration, i want to say that everybody have their point of view. I agree that watching sports it is spend of time, but a lot of people like this and it is better than wathing any show on TV, because sport is a important part of our life.
