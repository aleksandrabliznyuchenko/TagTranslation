Nowadays doing sports is very popular. Also there is developing of modern technologies. So many people have a hobby like watching sports events. But many others think that watching sports events is useless. in my essay I will discuss main arguments which demonstrate my opinion.
On the one hand, There are people who disabled to do sport themself, but this pastime is interesting for them. They know rules and process of the game is mesmerizing. People like these jut do not have an opportunity to play basketball for example. But it does not matter that they have to miss the chance to know something about sport. People need to know and sort out into many spheres of life for their personal developing. Also some of people think that watching sport is a good way to relax and get distracted. When people work about 8-10 hours in office they do not have forces to do anything. For example, there are many studies which research that about 50% of office workers prefer watching sport after work because it relaxes and soothes them. In my view, this activity is not harmful and if people like it so why not.
On the other hand, there are those who oppose to my opinion. Some people believe that watching sports events is wasting time. Actually if somebody love sport, he should do sport because viewing is not useful. Instead of this people can do many useful things like household. For example, according to research the absence of viewing sports events saves time by 20 per cent.
In conclusion, there are many opinions. Some people support that watching sport is a good method to relax, while other think that is wasting time. in my opinion, there is no bad that some of us like this activity because everyone have a choice.
