Nowadays sport became one of the most popular type of entertainment for many people, among with cinema and TV shows. Some people believe that spending time on watching sports, be it on TV or at live sports event, is pointless and useless thing to do. I strongly disagree with this opinion and in this essay I will provide some arguments in favour of watching sports.
Firstly, in my opinion, it is not up to other people to decide what a person should do in their free time, as long as it is not anything immoral or going against the law, which is obviously not the case. I think, watching sports is not any worse than watching cinema or shows in terms of spending free time to relax and enjoy. It can be said that sports are different from these types of entertainment as the outcome of a sports event is usually unpredictable, what makes sports very exiting.
On the other hand, watching sports means support for athletes and their outstanding effort, as they usually have to start doing professional sports in their childhood to achieve success. Moreover, watching sports and supporting your team also means providing support for your country of local community, which leads to unification and establishment of strong links between people of said country or community. Such things play a very big and important role in modern society where globalisation can often divide people. At the same time, watching sports and participating in related activities is a good way to meet new people with shared interests and make new friends, which is also very important, because it helps to support people's mental health.
In conclusion, I would like to say that I disagree with the opinion that watching sports is a waste of time, because, on the one hand, it provides a good way of relaxing and enjoying one's free time, and on the other hand, it includes some important social aspects that benefit people and their communities.
