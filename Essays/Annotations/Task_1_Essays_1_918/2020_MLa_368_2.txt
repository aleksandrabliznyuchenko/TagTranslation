It is not a secret that WATCHING SPORTS BOTH ON TV OR AT LIVE SPORTS EVENTS IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR ACTIVITIES WORLDWIDE. HOWEVER, SOME PEOPLE CLAIM THAT IT IS A WASTE OF TIME WHILE OTHERS BELIEVE THE OPPOSITE. In my opinion, watching sports is a good kind of leisure. Firstly, it unites people of different social groups. Take in consideration the fact that every international football championship involves residents of absolutely different countries. Secondly, watching sports is a good agenda for healthy lifestyle proclamation. For example, if kids see really interesting game and find it funny, there is a big chance they would like to join some team to do the same sport. Finally, watching sports can help the viewers to find new things or people. In fact, there were a lot of occasions throughout the history when people invented new things to develop spectator's experience. Take in consideration the development of cable TV in the United States, where a universal love of sports developed other industries.
On the other hand, there are those who is opposite to my opinion. They think that watching sports is meaningless while you can do sports yourself or even replace it with completely different activity. For example, you can watch computer gaming competitions or play computer games yourself.
I doubt this point of view as to my mind, watching sports is a quite good way to spend your free time. In the modern world where all types of entertainment are available with one click watching football match, Olympic Games or some other sport competition is a good choice for everyone.
All in all, globally people do not have to spend their free time on any interaction with sports. But everyone should take in consideration a great opportunity to enjoy watching a sport event or even take part in one. If all people follow this advice there will be a lot of happy players and sports fans in the world.
