Sport is impotant part of our lives and many people like watch live sports events. In my opinion, whatching sports is not a waste of time. In my essay I illustrate pluses and minesus this problem.
Sport is imoprtant for people health and support save your form. I think what whatching sports, live sports event and TV sports event support people explore sports and people start like real sports. 69 On one hand, if people watching sports than thay start analyze tactik of sport teams. This help us complite hard questions, because we upgrade tactik skills. For example, if human like watching football event they may be sometimes use tactik of his favorite sport team in real life. If this human will play football with friends, they can use move, which use players favorite team. If people like sports event than this human can start to do sport. For example, a many modern hockey players started playing sports, because thay have seen the matches of their predecessors.
On other hand, if people every day watching sports than they can start be lazy, because this people prefer watching sports and dont like play active game, for example, football and basketball. If people spends a lot of time in bad than they the worsen their health. No wathing matches will help, but sports will help.
In conclude, i think that wathing sports is not a waste of time, if this events motivate people playing sports.
