Sports always was a very popular and good for health. But nowadays wathing tv has become one of the common activities and a lot of poeple spend hours sitting at home or another places. And some people think that this is wasting time. While for other it is normal and interesting. As for me, I watch only big events approximately 1-2 times in several months. and i think that there should be balance.
Watching sport does not give benefits for your health but it is perfect way of entertainment. People watch sport with each other and it is great for socialising and communication. However spending huge amount of time at in front of television (not icluding live sports events) is bad for health while sport in real life give a lot of benefits.
For other people this is not interesting to watch sports
