It is argued that people who watch sports on TV or in real life are wasting their time. I believe that this point of view is quite close to true, but seeing sport events has its advantges too.
First of all, you waste your pasttime on watching others do sports while you can do in this time so many great things such as charity or ecology activism. In other words, time could be spend for doing really usefull actions that will improve life of the whole humanity. Also in this time man or woman can do sport excersizes themselves so they will be in the better physical form. For example, instead of watching football someone may play football in court with friends or even stangers. The other reason not to watch sports activities is angry fans of it. Sport often provoke argues and even conflicts between persons who support different teams. Sometimes best friends could become enemies because of this silly reason.
Nevetheless, visiting life sport events or wathing sport on television may help you to become more sportive, because seeing stong, beatiful, healty people makes you think about your own lifestyle. Sport changes our worldview and our ideals. For instance, person that watches sportive events such as swimming may go to pool and try to follow the example of favourite sportsman. There are even exists an opportunity that children will become a professional in the future if he or she likes some sport too much.
In conclusion, watching sports in spare time do not bring so many profit as other types of activities but sometimes bringes some good results.
