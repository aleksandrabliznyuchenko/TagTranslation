The one part of community believe that watching sports on TV or on big stadiums is a waste of time. But someone people like to watch sports because they prefer some comands. I tottaly disagree wtih them because. I think that watching sports is hobbie and everyone people may have some hobbies and watching sports as important as painting or bycicle. But this hobbie of wathcing sports have some bad moments.
On the one hand, when poeple watching the sports they offten support one of command or sportsmen. They believe that this command have to win therefore they experience strong feelings with their command. If their favorite command loose pepople who support them feel sad and empathy. They believe that command have to win at next time. And this people can be very happy when favorite cmmand win. This emotions help people when their experince stressful moments in their life. When people watching sport their believe that they is one part of big community which like sports as strong as they.
On the other hand, sport competitions make take several hours. Therefore this people can waste all day for watching sports and their family and child spend day without one of member of family. Some friends of this people can prefer theatre more than sports therefore their frandship may be broken. So that people have to organise their time for watchind sports and spend time with family and friends but that may be difficult.
In cocnclusion, i think taht watching sports is very important fo someone. Society cant forbid them wathcing sports.
