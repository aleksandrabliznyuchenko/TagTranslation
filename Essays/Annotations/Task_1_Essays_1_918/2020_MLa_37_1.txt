There are two charts, which show changes in the uses of Facebook from 2012 to 2013. So we can see why both men and women use this app.
Need to understand why it is go on.
On the first chart we can see, that in March 2012 more people used desktop for using app. But in March 2013 desktop was less popular then mobile. Maybe it can be explained that in March 2013 mobile phone became better, than last versions. They were more comfortable for using.
The second chart can show us, that always women spend more time in Facebook then men. But there is only one reason, which men and women uses in the same part. That is receiving updates. Probably, it works that, because women want to show life, different photos, videos, that they have a nice day, more than men. Men do not show how they work or chill.
Finally, we can say, that women spend so much time in Facebook for different reasons, but men also use Facebook, only waste less time.
