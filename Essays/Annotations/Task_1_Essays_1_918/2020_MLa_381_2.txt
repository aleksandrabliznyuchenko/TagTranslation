Nowadays, some people think that watching sports on TV or at live sports competions is a waste of time. I disagree with this statement and this essay will explain my opinion.
First of all, i believe that watching sports helps to improve the relationships between son and father. We have a much example of cases, when joint watching sports event on TV or at live improve mutual understanding between parents and children. For example, when i was 12, my father took me to the football match on my favorite footbal team. My happines knew no bounds. After that we began to communicate better with my father.
Secondly, i think that watching sports on TV and at live sports events such as FIFA or UEFA good influence on the development of sports among young people. Children and teenagers more interesting in different types of sport, learn more information about sports disciplines such as football, basketball, voleyball and also less active kind of sport such as chess, Gou, domino. For example, my friend since 14 he is fond of chess. He found out about chess by watching the chess championship. He is so pumped into a strategy, that it allowed him work in strategic consulting in Big3 in McKinsey.
In conclusion, I absolutely disagree with statement that wathcing sports is a waste of time. Watching sports on TV and especially at live events and championships can be helpful and amazing enought to change for the better you life, that you just can't imagine. My example and my friend's exampke prove it statement.
