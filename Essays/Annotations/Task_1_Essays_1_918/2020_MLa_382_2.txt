The recent upsurge in the wathing sports has provoked critical controversy over the possible damage it may inflict upon its personal lives. In may opinion, despite several benefits as a modern communication facilitator, the watching sport on TV or at live sport events is truly the root of people's drifting away from their sosiety.
On the one hand, the watching sports has undoubtedly been offering a tremendous assistanse to its users in terms of communication. To start with? the watching sports is the most poverful tool in keeping in touch with friends members regardless of geographic communication. Furthermore, people can make new friends with ease through the championat of sport, which not only expands their circle of social acquaintances but brings people closer together as well.
On the other hand, beneficial as it is? the watching sports? from my standpoint? still presents more detrimental consequences with that people's lives. The watching sports, initally, is highly addictive and people sometimes may abuse the ahcevmanget. In particular, youngsters are often tempted by the very idea of being befriended on the sports, hence their negligence on real relationships.
In conclusion, although the positive impacts the watching sports has made upon sosiety across communication spectrum, I am still convinced that people need watch sport.
