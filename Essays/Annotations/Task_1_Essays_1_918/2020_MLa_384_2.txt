There are two different opinions on the topic about the use of watching sports. Some people think about the useless of this activity. Others consider that it is neither harmful nor a waste of time. As for me, I almost agree with the first opinion because the time you spent sitting in front of the TV, you could spend in a much more better way.
First of all, lots of people, especially men, like watching sport channels sitting on the sofa, while their wifes doing their chores. This can provokes argues and other things between the members of the family. For example, the woman do her house work but her husband does not want to help, so the wife begin feeling some evilness. Undoubtedly, such behaviour can cause the lack of memory and also vocabulary in the real life out of the TV. For instance, there is a man, who sits in front of his favourite sport channel all day long, so gradually he will lost its possibility to speak with other people on a normal language and his vocabulary will become tighten.
On the other hand, there is a group of human being that disagree with the previous statement. it could be explained because of the emotional part of watching sports. People become happier and even get the inspiration from the things they like to do. So that there are football players that came from a little unknown town to watch the football match just to see famous players and the strategy they have on the field. All these facts give them new expirience. Nevertheless, there are some people that watching such programs just to take a breath in their busy life. For example, business man after his daily routine can watch sports and forget about his problems for a couple of minutes.
Taking everything into consideration, I would like to say that both points of view are able. Therefore, we should find the balance between different opinions, so it would be the best solution for us and our health.
