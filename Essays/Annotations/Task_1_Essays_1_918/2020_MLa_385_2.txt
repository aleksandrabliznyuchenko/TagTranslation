It is believed that there is nothing useful in watching sports events. Some people think that it is only a waste of time. However, I disagree with this opinion because I think that such an amusement has a lot of advantages which are quite significant not to consider that it is a complete waste of time. To start with, while watching sports we can broaden our knowledge. For example, we can learn a lot of new information about geography while watching a football match. Consequently, we may want to go to the country or city where this event took place and discover something new.
Secondly, rooting for any team we will get emotions that are so rare in our lives. Also it can help us to understand the psychology of any team. Both in sports and in life success depends on our perception of any event and communication with others. The same thing happens in sports. For instance, the main test of team cohesion in football occurs during a losing streak. In a strong team players support each other and sooner or later success comes to them.
Likewise, any person can find an idol in sports. And it can help in life because a person will have an example to follow, he can set himself similar goals and achieve them. Of course, there is a negative side of this argument. This person may not achieve the same great result as the famous athlete and this can lead to his depression. In this case watching sport events makes more harm than good. But such situations are incredibly rare.
In conclusion, although there is a very small probality that watching sport events will harm you, it is a good way to spend time which can also bring some useful life tips and even change your life. Also it can help you to achieve your cherish goal and to succeed in a career.
