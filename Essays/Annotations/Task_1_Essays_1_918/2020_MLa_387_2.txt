It is widely spread opinion that watching sports on TV or at some stadium is a waste of time. Some people claim that this type of activity takes a lot of time and brings nothing, while others think that it is an interesting activity that justifies the time spent for this. So this question is quite controversial and should be seen from different points of view.
In my opinion watching sports is a great hobby for fans of such games as football, basketball and other entertaining games. They imbued with competitive spirit and force people that root for their favourite team feel incredible emotions. Moreover, watching sports on TV or on stadium afford people to be in a good company of friends and to be in touch with them or find new friends on the stadium eventually.
On the other hand watching sports take a lot of people's free time and doesn't bring them any benefit or advantage of any kind. This time can be considered as meaninglessly spent.
To sum up, watching sports either on TV or at live sports events is a good way for sport fans to spend their time. Nevertheless, I believe that it demands a lot of time for them to have. But if a man really love sport and it is his passion, he can afford it to him at any price.
