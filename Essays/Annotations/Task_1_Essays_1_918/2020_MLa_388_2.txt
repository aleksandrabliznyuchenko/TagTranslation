In today's world some people believe that watching sports on TV or at live sports events is a waste of time. However, others have other point of view on this issue. In my opinion, it is important to be in a course of sports events because sport is a good chance to relax.
To start with, people who watch sports events on TV or at live can make new friends who have the same interests. For example, they have a good opportunity to meet and talk about their hobby together. What is more, young people who watch sports events have a good opportunity to become professional sportsmen in the future. For example, they watching some football match on TV or alive will see a great professional footballer. They will be fond of this kind of sport and want to become the same on their kumir. Personally, I believe that watching TV events is a good thing.
However, there is another opinion. First of all, some people are very busy at their work. For example, they usually go home very late. So people are very tired and they want to eat, rest or just spend their free time with relatives. So they do not to watch sports events and believe that it is a waste of time. To sum up, I would like to say that the problem of watcing sports events is still to be discussed. In my opinion, I think that watching sports is an essential part of human's life but people should choose themselves to watch sports events or not.
