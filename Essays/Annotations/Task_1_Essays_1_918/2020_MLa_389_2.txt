Nowadays, a lot of people enjoy wathcing sports events and this has become one of their favourite leisure activities. However, some people argue that spending hours sitting in front of the TV or at live is a waste of time and they reccomend opting to some physicall activity outside instead. From my perspective, watching sports is not a waste of time, but also there shoul be a balance between both: being an audince and being active yourself.
First of all, attending sports events is an effective way of relieving stress or experiencing great entertainment. Moreover, for many, this is not only passion, it is even a way of life. In most of the cases people share these emotions with others, so it gives them the opportunity to interract and communicate with different persons from various cultures and nationalities. However, spending hours after hours in front of the Tv screen and doing nothing else is certainly not a good idea.
In contrast, a lot of people suggest that watching sporting events on TV just to fulfil their spare time is not a beneficial action, as the free time could be utilised more effectively by taking part in some other physical or social activities for self-improvement. In addition, it is not a lie that people addicted to TV are more likely to become less sociable and develop different unhealthy habits, for example: eating junk food. Thus according to many, it is better to do various activities by yourself, rather than spending hours in front of the TV set.
In conclusion, we have to maintain a harmony in our leusire activities. Whyle enjoying ourselves on watching sporting events to relax, we should not have too much of them, as it may be harmful and try to combine it with some healthy social activities and programmes for self-development.
