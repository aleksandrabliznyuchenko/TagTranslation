The graphs shows the number of Facebook users in millions in the time interval from 2012 to 2013 and the reasons why men and women use it. Overall, we can see that the number of mobile users went up and the number of the ones using desktop app slightly decreased. Comparing the data that is shown on the second chart, we can see that the percentage of the female is higher in every listed reason, except for "Receiving updates", where it is even.
The first chart shows that there was a drop in desktop users of Facebook that caused a loss of more than 10 million users. But the mobile version of the app gained more than 35 million users which compensates the decrease of the first one. As a result, Facebook got approximately 25 million new users during that time interval.
On the second chart we can see that the listed reasons are more suitable for women and only one of them shows even distribution. Others have 8 percent or more difference. The highest percentages are shown on the first listed reason that is called "Sharing photo/video" and the lowest one is presented on the last one, "Learning about ways to help others".
