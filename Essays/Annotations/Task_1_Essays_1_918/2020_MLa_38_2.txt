There is a debate being held about whether it is useful to watch sports. There are people who think that it is not a good spending of time. I can only partially agree with that statement.
First of all, of course it would be much more effective and useful to play sports yourself because that is the point of it. If you want to get fit, play good individually or as a teammate, you need to practice and train your body and your mind. Laying down on the coach, looking at how others play will not bring you any good. It is better to spend your time playing than watching.
But it can be interesting to watch how professionals play. Seeing some outstanding moves from an all-time athlete is always motivating. It encourages you to go and do it yourself. Yes, you spent you time watching someone play, but after all you are willing to do something, make a move. And that's what a lot of people really need.
And let's be realistic: not everyone will be as good as Messi at playing football, so it is exceptional to see someone play like he do. The interest comes from the inability to understand and repeat the movements because they are highly complex and hard. But seeing the limits of what a human can do is always entertaining.
Summing up, it will not be a true statement if you call watching sports a waste of time. There are some positive sides of this process that can get you more into the game. But doing it too much can result into the imbalances that will not give you any benefits.
