Nowadays, a lot of people spend time at the Internet, but there are humans who watch the TV, basically sports events. There are two points of view about how watching sports influence on people: positive or negative. In my opinion, this type of spending is always a good idea, because you can inspire and enjoy the some game. But you don't remember do it right.
Obviously, people watching sports events since early times. You can see the real competition behind your eyes and get a lot of adrenaline and some unbelivable emotions. It's not a big deal to watch the sports on TV or at live time. Because if you are love this form of spending time, you will always do it, even you are in uncomfortable situation. For example, every 4 years countries show the Olimpic Games around the world. It is clear that this event attract a lot of people of different cultures, nationalities and ages group. Someone follow the competitions at home on the TV and other see this in real life at the big stadiums. Moreover, everyone get a lot of positive emotions and feelings, because all of them unite by one game.
In contrast, there are people who believe that watching sports on TV or in real life is a waste of time. Unfortunately, some persons sit at the sofa every day many hours after work. They often don't do some exercises to support their health, drink an alchocol and eat fastfood. For instance, in families man works all day at the job to get money in future. He back to home so tired and without a power to talk with him childrens and wife. Then man turn on the TV and watch footbol, maybe with him friends. Consequently, in family people begin to conflict and divorce.
To sum up, people should sometimes switch their mind on their hobby, including watching sports events. This type of spending time is needed for all of us, because you rest and enjoy it. I belive we should divide our time right and find hours on work or study and on our friends and lovely hobby.
