In the presented diagrams, we can see the number of Facebook users in 2012 and 2013 using desktope or phones. Also the reasons why users (men or women) used this social network.
Let's analyze the first diagram. Here we can see that in the interval from 2012 to 2013, the number of users using computers has decreased slightly. In 2012 there were 150 million and in 2013 135.
At the same time, the number of users using mobile phones increased from 55 to 95 million, that is almost 2 times.
Now let's look at why people use Facebook and how women's preferences differ from men's. We can see that the largest number of users use Facebook to share photos and videos, both among men and women. (39 and 54 percent respectively). Also one of the main reasons for using Facebook is receiving updates 39 percent each. They are followed by a view of funny photos and ways to help each other.
As we can see - user preferences depending on gender and year in which we live can change. For example phones are pushing computers out of the market and it seems to me this trend will continue.
