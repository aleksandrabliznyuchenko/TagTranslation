The subject of my essay will be the problem that come people believe that watching sports is a waste of time. The pros and cons are worth considering.
It can be noted that often the arguments of people who are opponents of watching sports and are perplexed by the populyarity of some of its types are the high cost of the event and uselessness for society as a whole of this type of event. For example you can often hear that it is worth cutting salaries for football players and giving money doctors or teachers or at least helping stray animals.
Now it is worth cosidering the argnuments of fans of certain sports as well as ordinary people who sometimes like to relax and watch for exlample football. We all know that sport is good for human health and in one way or another is associated with all of us from physical education at school to daily exercises in the morning. Therefore looking at the professionals in our field we subconsiously try to strive for the same indicators and be like them which is true not only in sports, but also in scientific fileds.
I believe that although athletes do not benefit science as such perhaps some do not even benefit society by their existence being mediocrity, but nevertheless there were cases when an athlete was terrible, but still very popular. Popularity at the present time with the right approach is very well monetized and many go to sports not to be better and set record, but for the sake of fees and popularity.
As a result we can conclude that it is foolish to deny booth the disadvantages of sporting events and the obvious benefits of their holding and such popularity among the audience. I believe that the more people will speak out about the excessive poplarity of sports the more discussed and popular it will become. Good or bad, but sport has been and will be a part of our life.
