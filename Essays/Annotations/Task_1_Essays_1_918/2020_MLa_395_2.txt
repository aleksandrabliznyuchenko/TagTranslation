Nowadays almost every person has a hobby, but sometimes we do not have the time and opportunity to do it. For many people, it is important to stay up-to-date with the events in their sports industry, that is why they watch competitions on TV or in the internet. However, some people believe that this is a waste of time. Instead of watching a video, you can do real sports, go to competitions, etc. Watching videos will not make people healthy and physically strong. In my opinion, watching sports on television is not a waste of time but there should be a balance between the time spent on watching sports and taking part in other social and sports activities.
First of all, watching sports is an excellent form of entertainment and for many, this is even a passion. It is very pleasant to watch sportsmen, they are slim, they lead a healthy lifestyle. They can be seen as an example to follow. By watching competitions in sport club or sport bar, you can make friends with whom you have many common interests.
On the contrary, many people claim that watching sporting events on TV to kill one's spare time is not a worthy activity as this time could be better utilized by walking in the fresh air, communicating with your family, deepening knowledge in the field of your profession. People, who watch TV most of the time, become isolated and often have bad eating habits. Thus according to many, watching sports on TV has both pros and cons, but we must not forget that training regularly is really important.
To conclude, watching competitions on television is a good way to entertain yourself. However, there must be a balance between sitting in front of the TV and taking care of your health through active sports.
