The graph illustrates changes in preferable devices to use Facebook from 2012 to 2013 and the main reasons to use it among men and women.
Overall, people tend to use mobile phone more in 2013 instead of desctop. Moreover, women better understand why they use this social media.
It can be seen from the first graph that usage of desctop to access to Facebook reduced between 2012 and 2013. In contrast, the amount of mobile users doubled at the same period. From the second graph it is clear that women as well as men prefer using Facebook for sharing photos or videos. Equal amount of respondents of both genders agree that receiving updates is one of the mainest reason for using this social media. Moreover, both genders claim that 'Learning about ways to help others' is the least prior in motivation to use Facebook. It can be seen in percentage disproportion between this option, where 25 per cent of men and 35 per cent of women agree that it is important, and sharing photos or videos, where average percentage is almost 47 per cent.
