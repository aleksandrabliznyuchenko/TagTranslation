It is not a secret that the dilemma of watching sports personally and doing it at home has always been debatable. Some people claim that the pleassure of watching sport contests personally is incomparably more than doing it online. However, others believe that watching sport at home is more convinient.
In my opinion, personal presence on the sport competition is better. Firstly, there is a special atmosphere on competitions that you can not create at home. For exemple, different chants on football matches, that inspire everyone to vote for their team. Secondly, spirit of unity makes you feel wonderful during whole competition. Finally, you can make new friends on the competition because of common interest and after sport contest discuss feelings and emotions.
On the other hand, there are those who oppose my opinion. They think that spending time on soft sofa watching TV translation is more convinient. Moreover, they think that ability to pause programm give them hundred points in debate with opposite opinion.
I doubt this point of view as to my mind atmosphere of unity is the most important thing in watching sport. Of course, pausing translation is very convinient but there is something artificial in this ability All in all, people can watch sport translations at home, but thus they never feel something special as unity spirit on the stadium. Visiting sport competition is a special occasion and thus everyone should experience it.
