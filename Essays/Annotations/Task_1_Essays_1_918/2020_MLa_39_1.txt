The charts show the difference in the usage of Facebook for 2012 and 2013 years among all genders, and also some of the main reasons for using social network.
The main feature of the figures is that we can see the dramatic increase of the mobile users over the year, doubling the amount from nearly 60 millions to almost 100 millions. Although the number of desktop users slightly decreased, the number still outweighs mobile users by nearly third of desktop users.
The reasons of people using the site also changed slightly, but the percentage for each reason dropped, excluding the 'receiving updates' reason. The biggest change happened to a reasons called 'sharing photos/videos' and 'learning about ways to help others', which dropped from 54 to 39 and from 35 to 25 percent respectively.
To sum it all up, total amount of users has increased over a year, and their reasons for staying quite differ from the old ones.
