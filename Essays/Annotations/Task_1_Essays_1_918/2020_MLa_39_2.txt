You can do a variety of things during your free time: hobbies, talking with friends or just a simple relaxation. But there is an opinion, that watching a broadcast of any sports or attending the match in real life is strongly unuseful. I personally agree with this statement, because in the 21st century there are plenty of hobbies you can do besides watching your favourite team, although it might have some positive aspects to it.
The main reason why I agree is that you spend your time watching the TV (or attending the live event) instead of improving yourself in your field of knowledge. As a student, I know how important it is to properly manage your time schedule. If one will waste a lot of time to fulfill their joy, they will not be successful later in life. Every year enormous amount of students get expelled because they were busy spending time not studying.
Furthermore, even if you are enjoying the sport so much, why do not try it yourself? Do not be afraid to improve your skills, if you are not as talented as the people you on TV or at live games. You will not only upgrade your physical appearance, but will have a lot of fun playing your favourite game and competing with others. Few years ago, I started playing basketball myself, and although it looked terrible at the start, I soon realised that watching games is nothing compared to playing.
On other hand, these activities is a way to relax for people doing hard work, or for people that do not have access to that kind of sport in their area due to their financial situation or lack of sport grounds.
To sum it all up, watching sport may be not as useful as something else, but I personally think that you should consider doing something to improve yourself. Only if there is no other activity, you can relax and watch a favourite sport.
