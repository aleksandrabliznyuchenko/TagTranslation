It is said that watching sport programms on TV can provide us with nothing but a waste of time. I agree with this statement and tend to think that depspite a lose of time, there are many harmful effect of such activitie and that there are plenty of much more interesting and useful things to do.
I believe watching TV, especially sport programms, which gives us an opportunity to what we call ''relax', actually turns our brains off. This leads to all kinds of brain and mental weakness, an infinite number af deseases and illnisses, in general, it spoils our live. For example, anyone, who has ever seen football at home must remember that cozy and relaxing atmostphere on your sofa, consuming all types of tasty food and drinks with friends or relativies nearby. In such conditions there is no danger for our existence, we fell appealence and neatness, and the same feelings shares our brain. Having the essential assignment to prolong our exsistence, to save our live from any danger, it loses his job, losing his power, turning from robust tool for various types of activities to weak receptor of images and sound from TV monitor.
As i said before, there are many other domains which can provide us not only with relax and pleasure, but develop, enhance our brain. For instance, instead of watching sportst you can do one or several on your own. This will robust your wealth, improve quality of your life, whereas private records and achivements will supply you with pleasure.
Overall, i would recommend everyone to quit watching sports and shift their attention to other activities which have closer connection to the real life.
