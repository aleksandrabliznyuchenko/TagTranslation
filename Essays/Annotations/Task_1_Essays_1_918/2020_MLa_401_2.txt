It is argued by some that whatching sports shows in your free time is a waste of time. Howewer, i completely disagree with this opinion and in this essay i will state the reasons for my view.
To begin with i would like to say that you can mix whatching sports with another activity like studying or working. It can be just on the background. Moreover, sports show can go while meeting with friends. Whatching sports shows in the background is better than music, because you can see the results of the match in real time, and you do not need completely distracted by the match. This is ideal way for a fan.
Another reason for my position is that whatching sports can give you energy and positive charge by seeing team spirit and desire to go all the way. In our everyday life, we are sometimes can be tired and exhausted. On such days we do not have enough strength and the bright sports show can give it back to us. Cooperation makes you want to move on and doing your best.
Lastly, watching sports shows is a good way for the novice athlete. You can watch the professionals and find cool tricks for yourself in the game.
In conclusion, I totally disagree with the opinioin that watching sports is a useless exercise. It is a good way to open your mind.
