Nowadays watching sports is quite a popular hobby, many people engoy it very much. However, there is an opinion that this hobby is useless, no matter watching it on TV or going to see it in real life. I absolutely agree with this opinion because of health and time-management aspects.
Firstly, sports events happen really often, almost every day, consequently, a person usually spends plenty of time sitting on one place and probably eating junk food. This way of spending free time is not healthy at all, even if not harmful. There are many other ways to have a rest and relax. For examle, that person instead of watching could go and do sports by him- or herself, instead of watching football go out and play it.
Secondly, watching sports is not like watching a film, because a person need to stay focused on a picture otherwise he or she probably would not understand anything. For example, talking about films it will be fair to say that you can just listen to film and it can be enough to understand everything. So, somebody can do something good like cleaning while "watching" a film.
Finally, some people say that there is no point in watching sports and I absolutely agree with them. In my opinion, it will be a better idea for somebody's health to do sports instead of watching them. Also a person can not do anything else while watching sports, when with films many people can only listen to them and do something at the same time.
