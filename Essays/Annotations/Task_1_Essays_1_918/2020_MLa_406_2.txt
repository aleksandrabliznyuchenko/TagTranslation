It is argued that people just waste their time when they watching sports events instead of doing sports. This essay disagree with that suggetion completely. This essay will firts look at the fact that people can share their interests and find new friends watching sports together and secondly discuss how fan's support is important for sportsmans.
Firstly, when people watching sports together they become closer. There are a lot of people who cannot do sports because of their phisical aptitudes, but they like wathing sports events and can do what they love in this way. Moreover, you can meet with people with the same interests at the live sports events and become friends. For example, I am a big volleyball fan and some years ago I went to the volleyball match in local sportcenter and when I was there I met with my first boyfriend. We are together now for three years.
Secondly, most sports events are puplic and people go there to support sportsmans. Sportmans get a lot of support from their fans at the competitions and it encourages them to do more, to play better. For examle, when in 2019 most sports events were closed for visitors because of the pandemia of Covid 19, and sportmans lost their motivation to do their best and, that it why, they showed bad results. People's suppot is valued by sportsmans.
In conclusion, I would like to emphazise that watching sports (either on TV or at live sports events) is not a waste of time because it helps people finding new friends and share interests, and, of course, fan's support is important for sportsmans.
