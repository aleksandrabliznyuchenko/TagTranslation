It is argued that there are a lot of usefull ways to spends your free time rather than watching sports. This opinion may be have a lot of supperters, with their strong arguments and I srtongly agree with that opinion. It can be seen, that there are a lot of dammage to the sport fans health and it causes huge ammout of hate in cases, then funs do not enjoed results of sport evet.
In one hand, people who likes wathing sports often whatch it large companies whis large amout of alchochol drinks. So, it looks very strange then peole get drunk when whey whatch football or baseball. They are wathithing for sportmens lifeslyle at the time there they cause dammage to theirelfs by the alchochol. Otherwise, then the companies get drunk it wery often causes conflicts for their favoirite teem lost and they start punching each other. In some cases it can be cause of heavy ingures and lethal ending. Its evidence that there are more dammage for health from sport wathing rather than actual sport activity.
In the other hand, sport teems always lose in sports events. At the same time funs often dissagree this their favourite team lose. This tipical situation generates huge amout of hate, and funs release it for usial civilians and their property. Sport hooliganism cause a lot of prperty, health damage, and this vulgar display of power from funs cause that more and more people hates sports activity. Hooligans for their actions makes sport acrivities unpopular in society eyes.
In conclusion, I want to say that wathing sport causes a lot of negative effects in our society, there are a lot of activities that can help to waste time more productive. Sport fanatism causes only bad reputation for sport activities, which is benefit from it is dfinition.
