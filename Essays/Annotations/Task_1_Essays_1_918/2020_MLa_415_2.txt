Nowasays, there are a lot of sports programs on TV and many people like to watch it. But there is an opinion, that wathing sports on TV is a waste of time. I like spots, but i think, if you are really love it, you will do it, but not watch on TV. There is no result of only watching sports.
Firstly, sport is an activity to improve your health, phisically situation. It has a lot of benefits only then, when you are doing it. Some people think, that with TV they will learn the nessusary tecnics or exersises they need. But it better to learn witch the practise. Moreover, I do not think that famous sportsmen watch sports shows instead of trainings.
On the other hand, some people say, that watching sports helps them to relaks after the hard day. But I think, if they will go to the gim, it will better not only for their brain, but for body and health at all.
So, at the end I would like to say, that doing sports is much better than loosing time watchig it on TV.
