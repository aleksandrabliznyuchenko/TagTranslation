Graphs provide information about Facebook users during the one year period, giving information about different devices people use and different reasons they use this website. It is clear that Facebook became a little less popular during this year and it is also seen that women are more common users of the website. The first bar chart shows that in 2012 about 150 millions of users liked desktop over mobile phone. The difference was critical, as we can see, only 50 millions of people used their mobile device. In 2012 situation slightly changed, the number of desktop users declined to 135 millions, but, on the other hand, people started to use their mobile phones more, it's numbers go up to 95 millions.
The second chart provide information about reasons why men and women use Facebook and, as it seems, the main reasons for women to use it are ability to share photos and videos, plus the opportunity to see funny posts. So, only 39% of posted photos belong to men, other 54% are from women. The same goes for funny posts, 43% of women like to see those, while there are only 35% of men who love them too. Women are also more interested in helping people. The numbers for receving updates are common.
To sum up, people still like desktop more than mobile phone and women are generally more interested in Facebook.
