It is argued that people should not watch sports games neither on TV nor in real life because it ts useless. I disagree with this opinion for several reasons. Firstly, watching sports may be motivational and, secondly, it is a great opportunity to bond with one another.
First of all, watching sports games can be really motivational for children and teenagers who still do not know what to do in the future. There are a lot of world famous sport champions who started as simple sport fans but then decided to be do sport themselves. So just like that, a regular hobby, such as simply watching sports, can help someone to discover their passion. For instance, Oxford's research shows that most of the current Olympic champions where once sport fans who just enjoyed watching sports with their family and friends.
Moreover, watching sports events together is one of the best ways to communicate with other people and find new friends. It is common for people to bond over their hobbies and it is espesialy common to sports fans, who are very vocal about their favorite team or player. Visiting sports games together or just watching it on TV gives people a reason to talk and to discuss something they care about, which brings them closer. For example, Stanford's research provides information that family members who watch something together (for example sports) are more close to each other than famiy members who do not.
To sumerize, whatching sports is not useless, because it may motivate someone to do sport and it also may bring people together.
