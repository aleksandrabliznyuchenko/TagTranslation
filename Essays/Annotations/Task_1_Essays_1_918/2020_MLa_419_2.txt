It is often argued that the people, who like a sport and like to watch it on TV or at live, they do not know valuable of time. I disagree with this opinion and i believe that watching a sport is a very interesting and useful hobbe and people who are watch a sport more happy. Firstly, people who watch a sport are more clever people because they wide their horizontal. Secondly, sport help people to be a fit, to be a healhy people It is clear that any sport helps people give a new information about this sport and the can use this information in the real life. Moreover, sport helps people remember ner rulers of this sport and people can train ther memory, this people can speak of this sphere with other people. other people understand thar this man or women has a wide a horisont. For example, according to recent recearch by Oxsford university people who is interested sport (who watch or train in real life) often take at work because the workgiver was interesting other interests their workers and they understood that this people more clever.
The second argument is sport can help people to de not weight and to be a healfy people. moreover, this people train their body when they watch sport because during watching a sport people, as a rule, have a lot of emotions. For this emotions people's bogy begin to work more hardly and the garmons of this emotion helps to be thin. Besides, watching a sport helps to be a healfy as a people get a good emotion from watching. For example, when i watch sport event on TV or real life i get a lot of endorthines and this emotions helps me to be a happy.
In conclusion, i not agree with people, who say that watching sports ia a waste of time. In my opinion, sport is a generation of our life, which helps us to be more clearly and more healfy. Sport events on TV or in real life need people for good emotions and happy for future life.
