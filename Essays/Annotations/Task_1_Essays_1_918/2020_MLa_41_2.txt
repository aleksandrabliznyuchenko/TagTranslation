Sport has always played a considerable role in people's life, no matter whether they participate in it or they Just watch it. However, there are some who consider watching sports events absolutely useless Pastime. In my opinion, it can't be a waste of time because it is an integral part of some people's lives and our society.
One of the reasons to support my opinion is that being a sports fan brings many people together. People from all over the world and from all walks of life, for example, come to see a sport event. Thus, they stand a good chance of making new friends or probably to finding their sole mates.
Another reason is that people must have a hobby and watching a match can be a good one. It can have a positive effect on a person's physical and emotional well-being as it helps people to unwind and distracts them from their everyday problems.
Finally, supporting a certain team is of vital importance for the players. For this reason, fans have always been a part and parcel of every game over the centuries. If people keep thinking that watching a match is a waste of time, the world of Sport will experience a sharp decline which is highly unlikely in my humble opinion.
In conclusion, while people may very in their opinions, i strongly believe that under no circumstances should watching a sport event be considered as a waste of time as this pastime has a positive impact both on an individual as well as on the world of sport and society on the whole.
