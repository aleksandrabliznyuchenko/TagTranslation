It is argued that people who like to use sport translations or visit stadiums for sport events are just missing their free time. This essay agrees with that suggestion completely because of the benefits spending time without such stuff brings to people. The essay will, first, discuss that participating in sport events more profitable than watching, and, second, give an arguments that cancel from TV sport translation can be financial useful.
It is clear that doing diffrent sport activities and exersises have a stong positive impact for mental and pisical health of people. When you are watching sports on TV or visiting live sports events you lose your free time on activity which do not give such a wonderful results like a self-doing sport.
