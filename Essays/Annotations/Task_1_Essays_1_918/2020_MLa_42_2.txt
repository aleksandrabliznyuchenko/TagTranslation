Sport is too important thing in our life. Some people prefer to do sport, others like to watch sports (on TV, for example) sitting on a sofa. Both ways are too interesting to my mind. It help us to relax after work days or spend time with our friends or family.
I think that watching sports is not a waste of time if people spend not so much their time and i disagree with the people which think that watching sports is a waste of time. As for me watching sports (for example, watching football games) gives me an ability to forget about some problems and to relax myself. Besides, watching sports let me to know a lot of interesting people which like it too.
In conclusion one can say that everything is bad if we spend all of time on this.
