The charts presented demonstrate the rate of Facebook use from 2012 to 2013, as well as factors that are thought to be the reasons for the use of Facebook in general by men and women.
Talking about the overall rate of Facebook use, it saw a slight decrease in case of accessing it on Desktop, whereas the rate of use on Mobile almost doubled during a year. As seen on the second graph, the main reason for using Facebook with both men and women is sharing photos and videos, while the least popular one is, evidently, learning about ways to help others.
A closer look on the first graph reveals that in 2013, the amount of desktop version of Facebook users dropped insignificantly from 150 millions to almost 140 millions. In contrast, the rate of mobile Facebook saw a great increase in popularity, with almost 100 million users compared to previous year's 60.
Upon closer inspection of the second graph, one can notice that generally, over 50% of women and around 40% of men believe sharing photos and videos to be the main reason of Facebook use. Compared to the least popular one, the proportions are almost twice as big, with only 25% of men and 35% of women believing learning about ways to help others to be the purpose of Facebook. Other reasons, such as receiving updates and seeing funny posts, seem to be more or less on the same level of popularity, with around 40% popularity among men and women on the former, and around the same proportion for the latter.
