A certain amount of people believes watching sports, regardless of doing so on TV or at live sports events, is not a productive way to spend one's time. The essay agrees with the following statement, because, firstly, it leads to spending unnecessarily big amounts of money, and secondly, it distracts people from doing actually useful things.
To begin with, some people tend to associate watching sports with wasting one's money, and this point of view has become more popular than ever nowadays. Among the reasons to consider this to be true is the fact that, often, people acquire a certain addiction to sports which can be compared to gambling: those keen on watching sports admit that they spend more than they would like on TV channels, tickets, and sports merchandise. The research conducted by Hilton University illustrates that the expenditures of sports fans are almost twice as big as of those who do not relate themselves to liking sports.
Another topic to cover is that watching sports can be somewhat hypnotizing, making people get on the edge of their seats just not to miss a bright moment of the game. Sadly, sports matches are known to take a lot of time, which attracts the viewers' attention for the duration of the match, making them unable to do anything but watch. A survey made by BBC shows that 80% of sports viewers admit they get so focused on watching, they have to give up on any work or studies, and 70% confess they would rather be doing something actually useful, but they really can not since this hobby is already an addiction.
To summarize, watching sports can be considered a waste of time because it leads to unnecessary waste of money, and makes the viewers unable to do any actual work or studies while they watch sports.
