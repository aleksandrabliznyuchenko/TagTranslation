The charts show the differense in an amount of Facebook users devided into two groups by gender and the resons for this usege in years 2012 and 2013.
Using own desktops by users for entering social network shows the highst rate in march of 2012, for about 150 users. Using of a mobile gagets for same thing in a certain year showed the lowest chart positions, about 60 only.
In march 2013 the rating situatin had balanced by a reson that desktop and mobile usage proportionaly changed. More people started to use their smartphones to chat and post in Facebook, almost 100 users. While less users continue doing same actions be desktops in a number of 135.
according two the second chart the resons of using such a website as facebook differes straight from the gender of the real user. Though, women mostly use Facebook for sharing media content such as photos or videos and seenig funny posts. Weanwhile, men prefer website for receiving updates and same media sharing. the lowest rating is showed by reason of learning about ways to help others. What a pity. Maybe that is just less atractive. To sum it all up, for today we know that users mostly chat by their mobilephones rather than it was in the past and the main reason why they actualy do this are funny posts and friends photos.
