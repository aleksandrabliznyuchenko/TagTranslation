There is an oppinion that sposrts watching is absolutely useless and I agree with this, nevermind you are watching it on TV or a stadium.
First of all, it might be sad that sport is a good thin. While playn a teem game you may contact with the others in a level of a family or develop tour skills, however watching sport with a bottle of beer just give you a visual illusion of such experience. You will never be healthy by this, never be stronger or more popular. You will just spend two hours watching how another people do this.
Second thing is there are a strange comunity of sport fans that decreas the will to be among them by fighting on stadiums, beating everyone around and making people suffering for their lovely sport team. such watchers bring millons of drafts to sports clubs every year. That is why you may think about looking on guys runing through the court at home, but look at the previous paragraph.
Never the less, there are people who realy likes watching TV matches, ond real events. They like that atmosphere of something gratfull or may be it just hellps them to reduce stress. They adore it and that is it. Do not wis anybody say them that watching sports is a waste of precious time. To sum it all up, the problem of usles sports watching is absolutely real as for me. And I believe that it is not logical to spend your time on such a things. However it is neccesary to understand, it is only the mean of taste.
