It is not a secret that many people to day asking them selves a question about wasting of time when talking about watching sports. Some say that it is just a waste of time, others dusagree. And I am absolutely disagree that watching sport is a waste of time. Firstly, watching sport is a greate way to become interested in differenf sports. If you are watching some sport long enough, there will be a moment when you will want to try it, and if you will like it, that means that you have just founf a new hobbie, so it is not looking as a waste of time. As for me, I have found my sport 4 years ago why while just watching sport channel on my TV, there I saw how people were playing rugby and now rugby became my sport.
Secondly, watching sport is relaxing. Some people watching it not because they are really interested in it, but because for them it is a perfect way to spend their time with friends or just relax lonely during the football watch on TV.
But others disagree and can say that there are a lot of ways to relax, and you can do some more important things like cooking, cleaning or may be just reading.
But what if you really like sport and interested it? It is more interesting to wath how your favourite team is wining than just reading book. And all so watching sport is really emotional some time, especially when you watch it with your friends. And you wil never get this emotions cleaning or cooking with your friends.
All in all, whatching sports is not just a waste of time, it is emotions it is relaxation with your friends. There are a lot of things that you can do instead of it, but wathing sport can really help you to find your self in som sport, and that will be very good for you and your health.
