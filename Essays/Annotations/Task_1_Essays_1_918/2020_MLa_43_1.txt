We can see from the second bar chart that more than a half of women users use Facebook for sharing photos and videos, while there is only 39 per cent of men. In addition, seeing funny posts and learning about ways to help others are considered to be main reasons more by women users that men (there is difference of 8 per cent and 10 per cent).
