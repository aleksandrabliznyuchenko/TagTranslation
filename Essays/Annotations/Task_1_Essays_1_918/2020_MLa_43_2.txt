Nowadays there exist different opinions about the usefulness of watching TV including sports in the life of modern people. Some people think that such kind of spending free time benefits someone's mood, while others believe that people who watch sports programs or live sport events just waste their time. This essay disagrees that watching sports is non-beneficial and will discuss both points of view.
On the one hand, there exist a strong belief that watching sports is like any other TV program or real-life hobby. To start with, when people are watching sport on the television, they can get distracted from their work and home routine and take a rest with friends. For example, many adult men like to drink a bottle of beer with their collegues or friends while watching their beloved football team playing in the evenings. As a result, it helps to feel the affiliation to a group of fans of a certain professional team. Moreover, sports can be a professional sphere for somebody. Therefore, watching others doing mistakes can help to improve your skills and knowledge.
On the other hand, a lot of people argue that watching sports is a useless activity. Their point of view is that you should better play sport by yourself, which would improve your heath and muscle. As a result, people can avoid different diseases and cancers.
In conclusion, I would like to state again that watching sports are not always a waste of time. It can be a kind of taking a rest who can not play it by himself or professional point for someone. I disagree that nowadays watching sports is useless type of activity because it can improve your knowledge in some sports, your skills and even make new friends among different team fans.
