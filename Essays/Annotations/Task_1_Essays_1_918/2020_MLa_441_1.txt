Charts shown above portray the amount of mobile and desktop users using Facebook and the differences in the reasons men and women use that social web.
The first chart indicates that in the March of 2012 users accessed Facebook mainly through desktop and the total number of users reached around 150 million. In March of 2013, however, the number of desktop users drops to approximately 130 million. Talking about mobile users, it can be noticed that the amount of mobile users in March of 2012 is significantly lower than the number of people using desktop for accessing the platform, standing at around 50 million people. That number, however, increases by around 40 million people in March of 2013 which indicates the sudden rise of mobile phone usage in regards to using Facebook.
The bar chart shows four main reasons of why people use the platform and the difference in those reasons between men and women. From the chart we can see that sharing photos and videos is by far more popular among women, standing at 54%, while only 39% of men use the platform for same reason. In terms of receiving updates, both men and women stand at the same number of 39%. Seeing funny posts seems to be more popular among women hence the number of 43%. The amount of men using Facebook for that reason is lower by 8%. Learning about ways to help others is the least popular optin among both men and women and stands at 25% and 35% respectively.
In general, amount of desktop users slowly declines, while mobile usage of the platform is on the increase. Also, women seem to show more interest in most reasons for using the platform except the update receival option, where both men and women have similar numbers.
