You can learn several things such as cooperation and team spirit. Usually sports teams exhibit a themendous level of team spirit and team cooperation that one can apply in one's daily life. Moreover, watching sports with our loved ones is a great opportunity to spend some quality time with them. For example I usually watch sport events with my family or friends.
On the other hand, i know many people who just watch sport events. When you ask them: "Why you didn't play footbal with me yesterday?". They say: "We saw very important match of our team".

Many times i tried to repeat their tricks with basket case. Moreover, if only see and never do how you train your body and mind to climb on the top of the world in each sport?
