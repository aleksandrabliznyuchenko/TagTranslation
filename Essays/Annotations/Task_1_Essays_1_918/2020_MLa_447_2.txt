Nowadays, thanks to technological progress, cheap travelling makes possible for sport fans all around the world to take part in any sport event, or to watch it live or recorded on any of numerous internet platforms. At the same time, there are people who think that spectating sports events does not worth wasting time on it.
In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with watching sports. First of all, watching events live is a very uniting experience for people who share a passion of sports with their friends. Secondly, live action can inspire young athletes to do better in their trainings, giving them motivation to do better and achieve new horizons in their careers.
It is understandable, why some people may disagree with this position. It is true, that sometimes sports fans spend too much time watching matches, forgetting about their jobs, friends, family responsibilities. It is also true, that in some sports fans can go violent if their team does not succeed well in the game. In this case, the last place where you want to be is the stadium filled with angry mob.
Nevertheless, watching sports events is still very important for the whole industry. Sports strongly depend on money made from adverising during commercial breaks or sponsorships. After all, sports can be the same entertainment indusrty, as films or books.
In conclusion, I would like to say that even though spectating sports may seem like a useless time spending, it still brings a wide pallette of emotions to people, who are devoted to their favourite town teams, country teams or athletes.
