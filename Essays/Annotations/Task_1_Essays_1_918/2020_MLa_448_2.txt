There is a belief that it is not useful at all to watch sport games on TV or live. I partly agree with this statement as I believe that it is more profitable to take part in sports and not to just watch it.
Speaking about the benefits of watching sports, I can describe a few of them. Firstly, watching different sport game can inspire people for some physical activity. For example, there are a lot of children who are fond of different team games (such as football or hockey) and who started to attend the lessons of these sports. Secondly, watching sports can be a pleasant and relaxing time for some people. It really helps sometimes to get rid of stress of everyday life and to feel those unusual emotions. Finally, watching sports together can be a way of communication. For instance, if your friends or relatives like some kind of a game, you can go and watch it with them and you will be closer to each other and build stronger bonds.
Speaking about my point of view, I believe that just watching some people playing games is not really beneficial for a person. To begin with, you can always take part in some kind of activity even if you are not really good at it. This kind of pastime will be useful for your body and your brain. Besides, instead of watching sports on TV you can watch a good movie, read an interesting book or do the work needed. From this perspective it is really a waste of time. Last, but no least, watching sports at live sports events can be dangerous as sports fans sometimes can be really crazy. You should visit this kind of events only if you are confident that you will not be injured.
In conclusion, I believe that there are a lot of other activities that you can do instead of watching sports. However, sometimes it can be a really pleasant pastime spent with your loved ones.
