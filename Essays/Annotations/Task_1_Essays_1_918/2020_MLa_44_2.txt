There are people who believe that watching sport competitions and games is not the best way to spend free time. They say that such way to spend time of a day is not as interesting and productive as it could be. However, i cannot agree with them.
On the one hand, watching sport events is not like participating in them. First of all, is could be much better not to watch sport event, but to do some sport instead. Of course, games are really fun, but it is definetly more interestinig to play football or basketball yourself. Moreover, this way to spend free time is much more healthy. Sport makes our bodies stronger and our minds more concentrated. Of course, the way more comportable to sit on the tribune or even more on the sofa at home, but it will not give anything but wasted time. On the other hand, all tastes are differen. We all different. Nevertheless, sport match can be rally important for someone. It could be really interesting to watch a football match with friends and an interesting to talk about after the end of the game. Many people have their favourite team since the time they were children. Also, spor events are a nice opportunity to relax after tough day at school or work. Some people migh not be great at spot and still love it. If watching spors makes someone happy, it cannot be just a waste of time. In conclusion, i want to say that althought watching sports may be really boring and inprodactive for someone, it could be really inportant and interesting for others. In my opinion, watching sports is a nice way to spend time with your family and friends.
