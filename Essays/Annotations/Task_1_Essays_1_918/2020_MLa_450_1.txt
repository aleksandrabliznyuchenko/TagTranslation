The bar charts below represent the changes in the usage of Facebook among people covering 2012 and 2013 years and the users' purposes.
In a nutshell, over the period shown, the number of Facebook users increased: near 210 and near 240 millions of users in 2012 and 2013 respectively. Speking about the main reasons of logging in Facebook sharing media content here is considered more important for both men and women.
People tend to use desktop interface more than mobile phones while they scroll the news in Facebook. And that is natural for both shown years: the number of desktop users doubled those who use mobile phone. Although there is a thing: mobile phone usage experienced a slight rise: it increased in almost 45 millions of users in 2013 in comparison to 2012. Desktop faced a small fall in its usaage: almost in 5 millions users in 2013 in comparison to 2012.
As for reasons that make people log in their Facebook accounts there is a general tendency that women have more aims to use Facebook than men. 54% of female users like shariing media, while only 39% of male ones prefer to do that. Men and women equally appreciate receiving updates from Facebook (39% for both). Seeing funny posts or memes is also a good reason to log in Facebook one more time, but women like laughing at posts more than men: 43% and 35% respectively. The sad fact is that only the third of the women and the forth of the men want to know how to help others: people nowadays use social media mostly in their personal purposes like posting, laughing and sharing.
In conclusion its clear that people use socail media for diffrent reasont: having a rest, getting something new, studying and education and other purposes. Nevertheless the number of users is extremely huge and that is going to be a problem in the future: how people should minimise a social media usage or possible ways of avoiding health and mental problems triggered by the technological point of the Internet and its content.
