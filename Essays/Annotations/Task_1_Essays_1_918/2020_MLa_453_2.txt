It is argued by some people that to attend sports events or to watch sports on TV is to lost your time. This essay completely disagrees with that statement. I believe that it is a good way to have some rest and spend time with your friends and family.
Firstly, the life in the modern world is a huge challenge for our mind and body since it is always needed to rush, to self-develop, to achieve different goals. In these curcamstances there is no time for normal sleep and rest. As a result, people are always tired, they do not have inner motivation and feel apathy. A great way to release stress after difficult workday is to cheer in the favourite teem. A case in point is my dad which really likes to buy some fast food and watch football, hoockey or basketball plays. It helps him to distract from everyday problems.
Secondly, sports events are a good reason to gather with friends. With the Internet and social networks particularly, meetings in real life are becoming rarer and rarer, people are becoming more alone and isolated. Sports arrangements allow us to have some fun together. Take, for example, the story from my experience. When I was younger, I played in a basketball team. It was an incredible tradition to attend matches of the Russian national team. It united us and made us consentient.
To conclude, I cannot support the idea that watching TV events is useless since it provides many opportunities to relax and to enjoy the company of loved ones.
