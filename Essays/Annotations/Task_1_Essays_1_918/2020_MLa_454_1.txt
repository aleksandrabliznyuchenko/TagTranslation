The graphic illustrates the progress of using the Facebook and the goals of it among men and women during the period from 2012 to 2013.
In general, we can see from the charts that the usage of mobile Facebook app in 2013 have increased almost twice since 2012. At the same time, the using of desktop is slowly falling in this period of time. Speaking about the reasons of using the social network among the genders, it is obviously that the most common goals are sharing photos and seeing funny posts. Those reasons especially popular among women-for example, the category "sharing photos\videos" takes more that 50% of answers. However, "male" goal of Facebook usage, except the photos and videos, is receiving updates from friends and others: those two options take equally 39 percents in the graph percentage. The less popular activity of network among the both sex is learning about the ways of helping - charity.
From my perspective, I think we can observe the global tendency of growing popularity of mobile apps via these charts. Also, we can say that the reasons of using the Facebook are quite the same in comparison of genders.
