It is often argued that watching sport programmes on TV is just a way of wasting your time. However, I stand for the opposite point of view - sports activity on TV can be even effective type of your leisure time. Firstly, by watching sports on TV the one can feel the atmosphere and the spirit of such activity. It may leads to the big motivation of doing that by oneself in the further. Moreover, competitions on the TV can teach the one rules and help to get the knowledge about the sport it represnts, so it also may wake the interest to it up. However, even not, the sport (either on TV, either online) gives us the good feeling of supporting the team, for instance. So, it is still profitable for us.
Secondly, our decade is commemorated with pandemic situation that leads to the common lockdown. In such brand new world the most of the sports are cancelled for us. Therefore, watching it by the TV is helping to stay motivated and even in the shape - it is proven by the scientists that only watching sport on TV replaces the real physical activity in some points. From this perspective, I think that watching sport competition help to keep our mental stability up as well.
In conclusion, I want to say that real sport activity in gym or at stadium is one of my favorite way of free time. Nevertheless, I still believe that watching sport programmes also has list of benefits, so it cannot be a waste of time.
