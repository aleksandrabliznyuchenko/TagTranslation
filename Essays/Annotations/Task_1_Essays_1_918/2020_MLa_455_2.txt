Nowadays sports events are less popular. Some human beings told that watching them is a waste of time. Somebody agree with the statement and others disagrees. I am one of the humans who think that watching sports is a good leisure activity.
However, watching sport is a good hobby. But if you want that your hobby will be useful, sport lovers think you should know a lot about sport in theory and practice. It is hard to understand the goal of something if you do not know the simple things. Secondly, you should find your favourite sport. There are different types of sport from running to figure skating. Someone can watch only beautiful kinds, but others like, for example, such games as football or baseball.
Consequently, some people think that the group of lovers whom like to watch sports events on TV or at live just waste their time. The reasons why they think so are simple. Watching sport events usually spend a lot of time. Its average is 3 to 5 hours. The opposition group believe that you can do something else that can be more helpful.
As for me, I do not think that it is a waste of time. The sport is suitable for everyone. Just make your own choice. For instance, I am in love with figure skating competitions. I can watch them unstoppable.
In conclusion, despite the existence of some opinions against this early decision, I disagree that watching sports is a waste of time.
