The first bar chart shows the number of people using desktop or mobile versions of Facebook. It also shows the difference of number of users in March 2012 and March 2013. After a year, the number of desktop Facebook users has decreased from 150 million to 135, while the number of mobile users has grown by 50 million people.
The second bar chart shows the most important functions of Facebook for men or women. 54% of women uses Facebook primarily for sharing photos or videos, while only 39% of men uses it for the same reason. It is very interesting that men and women are equal in interest for receiving updates. However, the most unpopular feature is learning about ways to help others.
To summarise, the first bar chart illustrate the growth of the Facebook mobile audience, while the second bar chart shows differences between men and women in their favourite Facebook features.
