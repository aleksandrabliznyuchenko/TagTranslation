Nowadays the issue of importance of watching sports becomes popular. One side of people thinks that it should be a part of our life, while other disagree with them. Personally, I think that there are a lot of other facinating events to spent time on rather then on it.
First of all, when human beings watch sports, they usually are overvelmed and agressive. This can cause noise and, thus, police problems with neigbors in case it is a TV programm or even a a fight if a person outdoors. For instance, footbal fans are one of those. It is not a rare case of deaths between them just because of their interests in different teams. If people want to release their agreesion it would be better and more healthy for them to do it doing some sport.
Furthermore, there is no profit in watching sports. People can not learn new skills for work, hobby and even life. It seems like a wasting of time for me. It is also takes a ot of time, because usual match longitude is approximately 2 hours and when it is a championship it takes the whole day. So that might be useful only if all of your friends are sport fans or you doing sport yourself because this is a part of your career. Thus, it is better to do something more important, for example to do homework or read books.
To sumup, nevertheless people like to watch sports, it is not the best decision for them. Taking into consideration agression problems and no profit from watching, I conclude that it is definetely a waste of time.
