Every day more and more types of sports appear and it gets more and more people to engage with it. While some people may argue that watching these sports is just a waste of time, I believe that it is a good thing to do, and in this essay I will discuss why.
To start with watching sport may actually make a person to get involved in it. If a person is passionate about a particular sport: she or he watches every game, knows all the rules, etc., it means that there are high chances that they would want to try it themselves. And participating in a sport is beneficial for the person in many ways, not only does it improves the physical health, but it also improves the mental one. Person meet new people, make new friends and just in general has a great way to relax after the day of sitting in the office or university.
Watching sports is also a great way to bond with family and friends. When a person gets interested about a certain thing, it is likely that people surrounging them will also become interested about this thing. And if they have a same interest they discuss it and, in the case of sports, watch it together. In other words, they spend time with each other, when otherwise they would probably have been busy with their own business.
To sum it up, I wholeheartedly believe that watching sport can bring a lot of joy into one's live and that it is not just a waste of time.
