The bar charts represent the changes in using Facebook with mobile phones and with desktop and the reasons of being involved in this social network for male and female users.
The main pattern that we can observe in the first graph is that more and more people switch from desktop to mobile version of Facebook. The amount of people using this social net with desktop slightly decreased by approximately 12 millions in the period from 2012 to 2013 while the number of people using the mobile version has grown dramatically - from 60 to 100 millions.
In the second plot we can see that women dominate in almost all reasons of using Facebook - the only point where persentage of men and women votes are equal is receiving updates. Male rates for sharing photos/videos, receiving updates and seeing funny posts are almost equal with values of 39, 39 and 35 percents respectively, while learning about ways to help others is the least popular reason for them with rate of only 25%. This last point is the least popular among women as well - only 35% of them estimated it as important. Seeing updates and funny photos are the points that take 2nd and 3rd place for female users with values of 39 and 43 percents respectively. Sharing photos and videos, however, is the most essential for girls - more than a half of all female respondents stated that this was a main reason of using Facebook for them.
