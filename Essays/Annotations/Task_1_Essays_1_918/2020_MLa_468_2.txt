There is an opinion in the society that watching sports is useless or even destructive way of spending time. It is hard for me to agree with this opinion as I myself enjoy watching football matches sometimes and I would really love to visit a live game one day. In this essay I will try to show why sport events can be fascinating and even beneficial for a person.
One of the reasons why people say that watching sports is a waste of time is that you does not develop yourself while sitiing in front of a TV screen and observing some strong men kicking a ball or doing some similar things. The main argument here would be that instead of just watching you could go and do sports yourself so that you will get healthier and get some practical knowledge.
I would argue with this point that do sports yourself is better than watching it. Fristly, we do not always do things to develop ourselves - sometimes we just do things for fun, to relax and spend good time. We watch TV shows, movies, listen to music, so why watching sport games is worse than all these activities? Admiratuers can get positive emotions from observing professional players showing a good game and even get aestetical pleasure from it.
Secondly, an individual might watch sports not instead of doing it himself/hirself but together with it! A lot of sports fans dream to play and look like their idols and do a lot of efforts to achieve this. Watching sport events can inspire people to do sports themselves and, consequently, become stronger and healthier. Besides, a person who does sports can learn a good theory from watching how professionals play, and spend time at trainigs more effectively.
To sum it up, I can say that, of course, many people do not admire watching sports and do not consider it a useful activity for themselves. However, I hope I was able to prove that sometimes even sports on TV can be beneficial and there is no need to judge people who regularly watch and enjoy it.
