Here are two charts in front of me: the first one compares the dynamic in types of gadgets used among the audience of Facebook and the second one that describes the purposes of Using Facebook distributed among sexes.
The former graph is a horizontal barchart with two scales. The x-axis is defined by the amount of users - the units are the amount of people. In turn, the y-axis is a categorical one that has two values: "March 2012" and "March 2013". We can see a steady drop within computer usage during this period and a dramatic jump within the mobile phone usage - the amount in a year has risen to more than 50 per cent.
The latter graph is a hoizontal one, having percentage on its x-axis and a categorical variable with values that stands for the reasons to use Facebook on y-axis. It is interesting that both sexes use Facebook in the same proportions within only one reason - to check for the updates. In the rest of the purposes, women tend to use this social network in higher proportions. The highest gap lays in sharing media content.
