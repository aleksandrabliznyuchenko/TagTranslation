In the first quantile of the 21'st century people tend to concern on the purposes they spend their time for. By estimating the utility of spended time, some people tend to believe that watching sports is defintetly not profitable. Let me elaborate on this topic.
Personally, I disagree with this statement. In my opinion, the first advantage to watch sport is that it is a good reason to ghave fun with your friends or family. Next, if some kind of sport is person's hobby, it is good to keep in touch with current state or watch some historical moments. Last is that if a person started to learn new sports, wataching related content helps to carry out the rules and traditions of it.
However, people anticipate saying that watchers should go and play sports instead. Nevertheless, a person may have not playgrounds nearby, be too tired, have lack of time, have no free facilities and enough money for paid ones.
Summing up, though watching sports is doubted to be a useful time-spending, this has strong several advantages to do so.
