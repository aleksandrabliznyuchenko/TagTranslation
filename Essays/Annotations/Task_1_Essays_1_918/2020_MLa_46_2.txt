Nowadays watcing sport is one of the most popular daily activities for all the genders and ages. It is argued by some people that watching sports is a laisy and non-productive way to spend your time which is known as the most important resource in modern world. I disagree with the opinion of these people, I completely sure that such activity has many benefits for everyone.
To begin with, watchin sports helps people to feel themselves as a real sportsmens who tries to win, it helps to provide some adrenaline into our daily routing. Watching sports exhibit a high level of team spirit also for those who cannot be at the stadium. For example, it is impossible for all the people in the world to come to the olimpic games and watch them offline, so watching TV helps people to solve this problem. By the way, watching sports can provide feeling of national unity, and many goverments can use it for diffenet purposes. Morever, some people cannot be sportments for different reasons and it would be unfair If we will start to say that theyshould find another activities.
In addition to what I have already mentioned, watching sports motivate people to become sportsmens or start physical training. So it might be better than watching serias everyday. Also parents can inspire their children to do some sports by watching it on TV. For example, many olimpic champions reached their high results because they were keen on their sport since childhood.
