Sport events have been an important part of human culture throughout the history. Today they are available to very large audiences, people can watch them on TV or on the Internet and live in huge arenas. While some people enjoy watching sports, others believe that it is not worth spending time on. This essay will provide arguments on why in modern society watching sport events can be a waste of time. To begin with, sports have been a main source of entertainment in ancient history. Back than we did not have technology or developed literature and theater. However, nowadays there are other activities that are both more pleasant to watch and provide knowledge. Sport events, such as football games and Olympics always imply some competition and a viewer usually has a team that they want to win. As a consequence, watching such content can cause a lot of stress and anger. Sports are also not the best way of entertainment, because it is not educational and does not bring any complex thoughts.
One of the arguments of sports events' proponents is that people who watch them are genuinely interested in them and love sports. In my opinion and from my observation, it is usually not true. The majority of viewers do not do sports themselves and are not interested in any particular sport, watch it occasionally on TV or fun. For such people watching sports is a waste of time. A better option would be to go for a run in order to expereince physical exercise on their own or watch documentaries, films about important sport events and figures.
In conclusion, watching sport events is not the best way of spending one's free time. It does not evoke any positive emotions or thought, nor is it educational. There are better activies connected to sports, such as actually doing it or reading about sport history.
