Should people spend their time watching different sports translations and TV programs or not is a controversial issue. While I understand that it may seem a passive and useless activity, I disagree with the claim that it is a waste of time and in what follows I will explain my thoughts.
Watching sports can expand people's purview and bring unforgettable emotions to audience. Firstly, it gives knowledge about different games and types of sports, about the history of this area and interesting facts about athletes. For example, one may learn about Olympic games which is one of the most influencial sport events in the world and understand not only the content of this contest, but also what it means for countries to participate in it, what it symbolizes as a social phenomena. Secondly, watching sport games which are usually based on team working process show pure strategic decisions and interactions, so audience can follow the flow of the game and recognize the reasons and consequences of aome particular decision. It is useful for understanding of psychology of people and for decision-making in real life. Finally, this activity is full of different emotions which can make you close with fans and other people watching sports. It is a good topic for conversation and a reason to make friends with persons similar to you.
Some people think it is a waste of time, but I would argue the opposite. For instance, they say that if one wants to do sports, they should not watch it, they should do it themselves. I believe it can not fit all the people as there are a lot of ones who is not physically able to do sports. Besides, doing sports can be not so fun as watching it. Also, these people might say that watching sports is boring. I would answer that tastes differ, and once you watch sports you would never forget this experience.
All in all, watching sports is definetely not a waste of time: it is rather a good source of different knowledge and a decent way of making friends.
