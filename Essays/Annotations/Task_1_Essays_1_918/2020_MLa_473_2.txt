There exists an opinoin that watching sports no matter offline, online or on TV is absolutelly useful. I do not agree with this position. As for me, watching sports sometimes can be as exciting as watching a good movie.
To start with, the main aspect that influence my position is strong emotions that one can get watching sport games or competions. We can feel joy and happiness if our favourite team is showing a great result or we can be sad dissapointed with their looses - all of these can help to distract from routine and personal problems and relax. I suppose that it is the main function of such kind of activity. Moreover, some types of sport are so beatifull that watching it can bring a great estetiqe pleasure. For example, figure skating where a lot of competoins look like an amazing show with fantastic music and costumes. All of the sportsmen try to impess judges with interesting programs with great amount of difficult elements and dangerous tricks. It is definetely worth to watch! Finally watching sports can also bring one's horizon. Knowledges in this area can be really helpful, for example, in the situation there it is needed to find a contact with particular people.
However, I can understand people who claim that watching sports is a thing that wastes time. Firstly, in this situation a lot of things depends on the personal interests. If a person do not love sport at all, of course they will not recieve any good emotions from watching a football match on TV. Secondly, some people can enjoy sport only in case if they personally take part in it. And it is difficult to deny that real life activities always wins.
To sum up, I want to say that to watch or not to watch is the question of personal interests and motivation. But for many people including me watching sport is a great opportunity to have a good time that brings a lot of positive emotions.
