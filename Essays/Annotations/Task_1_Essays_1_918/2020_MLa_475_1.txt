The graphs illustrate the distribution of electronic device use in 2012 and 2013 and provide with gender-divided list of resons for Facebook membership. The first bar chart outcome is presented in millions, while the second graph results are shown in percentages.
Overall, the first chart demonstrates the decline in Facebook use and a change in the device used to visit the source. Also, the second graph depicts four main reasons for sticking to this exact social network among men and women.
The important note that can be made about the first bar-chart is the increased use of Facebook happened during one year: it is only 60 million users visiting this social network via the mobile device and 150 million members surfing Facebook from their PCs in 2012 compared to 100 and 140 millions in 2013. Another important feature of the analytics shown on the first graph is general switch between devices: mobile application was way more popular in 2013 than in the previous year, while the number of desktop users slightly decreased in just one year.
The second picture shows that the main reason for using Facebook was sharing photographs and videos; the proportion of women considering so was higher (54%) in comparison to men where only 39 percent presumed it to be the purpose. Also, the least preferred option for Facebook was helping others, which again was suggested by women in greater degree than by men (35% and 25% respectively).
To sum up, the results can tell us that in later years users prefer mobile devices to surf the social network in order to use it for sharing their pictures.
