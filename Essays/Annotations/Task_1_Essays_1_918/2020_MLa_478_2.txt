Nowadays people tend to translate skeptical attitudes towards watching sports considering both on TV and at live events. I completely disagree with such trend seeing in the society, as sport programmes and competitions are a decent way to spend one's time as well as watching movies and TV shows, listening to music and other activities.
To start with, all people are different and may not have the same preferences. Moreover, the most important thing about some kinds of entertainments is the impact that a certain activity has on individuals. For the lost of centuries men and women were curious about football games or athletics events because in some extend watching sports is just like reading the books or visiting friends. It may bring people joy what is important in our contemporary life which is full of stress and duties.
Another reason why I disagree with the negative believes about sports is that the meaning of this word i too broad to form a strict view on it as an meaningless set of actions. Chess, for example, are perceived as sport as well as playing the MMORPGs and swimming. So, I believe that people who are interested in such kind of actions may be motivated to improve themselves in absolutely different life areas that is a good hobbies advantage.
In conclusion, despite some individuals believe that TV programmes or life sport events are a boring or not intellectual activity to spend the time on, I believe that games and other shows are a normal part of human life and since they can bring watchers some positive emotions, they have some sense.
