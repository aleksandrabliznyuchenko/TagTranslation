Although some people are sure that watching sport events online or on television is just a waste of time. I cannot agree with this position and I will explain it with serious arguments.
The first and the major argument is people, whith whom you usually watch the game. In my humble experience all sports events were watched with friends or just people I knew. It relaxes and gives a feeling of a team. This usually manifests itself in very controversial situations during the game. It makes a feeling of presence on the pitch when it comes to footbal or presennce in a game when it comes to some video-game tournaments, the feeling that you are playing the game with people around you.
The second argument is auditorium occumpancy on the event. Undoubted advantage of modernity is that nowadays you can watch all the events, even they reach the smallest audience online. All because places in which sport event takes place can't accommodate all the people, that are interested in specific sports match. Stadiums for thousands of people can't accomodate millions of fans from all the countries in the world. And in the past it usually caused many problems for people, which wanted to watch the perfomance of their favourite team or even a favourite player. But with the advert of television and then with the advert of different streaming platforms this problem was solved.
In conclusion I want to say that i cannot agree with position in witch watching sports online or on TV is equated to a wasted time. It allows many people to enjoy their free time with friends watching the match of their favourite championship, team or player.
