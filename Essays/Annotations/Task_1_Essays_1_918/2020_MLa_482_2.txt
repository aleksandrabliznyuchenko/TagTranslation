Spending the time enjoying sport events on TV screen or at real life is said to be a nonrational usage of time. In what follows I am going to argue why this statment is the true.
People are keen on whatching sports because it brings them some sort of adrenalin. However, it is not that interesting and exciting as they tend to think. First of all, sport-watchers would get much more fun doing sports by themselves rather than sitting somewhere on a sofa or a stadion and eating junk food. Another reason to reconsider about whatching sports is that people fight a lot because they do not see eye to eye with each other about their loved sport teams. Screaming and offecning one another does not seem as having a quality time. So, following sport events brings nothing but overeating and fighting.
Whatching sports may be not only a waste of time but also a dangerous adiction. There are some people who like gambling and making bets on sport events. This type of activity can easily make a person homeless, poor, unhealthy, or even dead. The ones who are involved in gambling usually do not recognize that they need help. Thus, they are in a potential danger because of their adiction to gambling and whatching sports.
To sum up, although at the first sight whatching sports seems fun, it can bring serious troubles. There are many other useful and interesting activities to do.
