There is a belief that watching sporsts is a waste of time, however, I strongly believe that this practice can be considered as positive. In this essay I will prove why watching sports can be beneficial.
To start with, sports is a world-wide billion industry that always seeks for new people. People, who watch a lot of sports, know this field well and can make money of it. For example, some make sports bets on different football teams and win thousands of rubles because they have great knowledge about the teams and can predict the outcomes. People can be also hired based on their sports knowledge. For example, my friend is a basketball fan, and he also worked on a radio in school. A couple of years ago he saw an ad for an open vacancy for a basketball host (the person who has to give relevant comments during the game and entertain the viewer during the breaks). Since he had some experience in a similar job and had a lot of knowledge about baseball, he got the job. Now this friend has his dream job, makes good money on it and it is all because he watched sports.
Moreover, sports can also be a great way to get new friends. Social studies show that the best strategy to meet new people is through the shared interest circle. For example, you can go to some live sports event and talk to the people sitting near you. There is a big chance that this communication can be a positive experience of gaining a new friend. Many of the people I know get together in a sports bar to watch the games and get to know new interesting people.
To sum up, though some poeple consider watching sports a time-waste practice, I am sure that it is a great way to develop and reach your goals.
