Barcharts illustrate dynamics of which device is used for using of Facebook and show the difference between men and women in reasons of using. The first barchart shows that more users started to visit Facebook by using of mobile phone. Since 2012 this number has been doubled from around 50 millions to 100 millions, and number of desktop users decreased at the same time. The second graph shows the difference of reasons for using. People more often uses it for posting of photos/videos and receiving updates. These are reasons why people started use mobile version more. It is more comfortable to take a picture and immediately post it on Facebook, rather than upload it on desktop and only after that publish. In addition, it is obvious that men and women have different reasons for using of Facebook. Men more rarely post photos and vidoes and see funny posts. For them the main reasons is receiving of updates. The difference in case of posting photos is equal to 15%. Thus, I can assume that men more often use desktop version than mobile comparing with women. Average men, according to the graphs, does not post photos often, so it is not necessary for them to be able to upload it as soon as possible.
