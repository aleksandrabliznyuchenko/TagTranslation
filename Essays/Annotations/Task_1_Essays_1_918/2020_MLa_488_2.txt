There is a wide discussion about the necessity of spending time watching football and hockey matches and other events connected with different types of sport. Some people have the point of view that it is destructive way of spending time and it gives nothing essential for you. However, others, argue that watching sports activities has some advantages for people who really keen on it and I agree with this opinion.
Each of the opinions has a rationale but my personal view is that watching sports is not the way to waste the time and people may have some valuable reasons to do this. To begin with, in modern world we have much business to think about every day, and we have to give us some time for a rest doing the things that allow us forget about regular problems. I think people who are interested in sports have a great opportunity to organize such a rest watching the match. Besides, for some people sport is a hobby, and it is always interesting to discuss the sport with them owing to the fact that they watch the sorts programs regularly and, consequently, know a lot about it.
The opposite view usual argument is that you can spend the time on reading, studying or something that is important to you instead of watching sports. Nevertheless, I think that people have to spent time on things they really love in order to feel good, although I agree that there are many significant things to do.
To sum up, I would like to emphasize that opinions differ and there is a great deal of truth in each of them, though I support the view that watching sports may be beneficial for some people due to the fact that it gives them an information they are interested in.
