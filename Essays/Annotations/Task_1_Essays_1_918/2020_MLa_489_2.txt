The interest to sports and sport events is shared by a huge amount of people. Nevertheless, some people believe that watching sports is unproductive spending of time. I can't agree with this opinion. To my mind, watching sport events has some drawbacks but also many advantages.
Some people think that watching sports is a waste of time. Firstly, it has more benefits to be really engaged in physical activities instead of watching it. It badly influences physical shape of a person who prefers to watch sports and not doing it. Secondly, sometimes people get addicted to watching sports. For example, some men are very big fans of football and they spend enormous amount of time watching matches. Moreover, this addiction may lead to spending money on guessing what team will be the winner.
However, I believe that watching sports can have benefits for people. Firstly, visiting live sports events is an opportunity to get together and spend time with friends or significant others. Such events tend to make people closer to each other. Besides, for someone it is a chance to make new friends, who will share the interest in sports and maybe even support the same team. Secondly, visiting live events or just watching it on TV can motivate people to try some sport by themselves or improve their physical shape with regular workouts. For example, some currently successful sportsmen were inspired by their favorite players and that gave them motivation to work hard.
Overall, watching and visiting sports events influence people in different ways. For some people it is a way to have a good time or get motivated for their own achievements. Others interest towards watching sports can make passive and even addictive.
