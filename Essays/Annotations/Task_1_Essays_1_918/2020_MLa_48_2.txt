No doubt, nowadays lots of people interested in sport, however that issue is rather controversial. So, some men think it is essential to follow any sport events in order to be aware of the current situation in sport world, while others believe it is not nessessery to watch news and programs or attend to some activities somehow connected with sport.
I partially agree with the statement. Firstly, sport can interfere in someone's personality. If you are a big fan of any sport, you will be healthy and stay away from harmless habits. Secondly, when you are involved in sport activity you have preferable environment around you. It means you are among people who share your interests, also you can give each other a piece of advice. Thirdly, sport is a life. If you do not move you become lazy and loose you motivation to do work or gain knowledge and experience. Following news and event connected with sport gives people consciousness and make them do any sport activity.
On the other hand, when you watch TV or some shows in computer, you waste time you could spend on walk or gym. So, if you want to be a part of sport team, just enjoy the company. Moreover, while you are at home, sitting in front of the monitor, you are getting use to be indoors and order or cook unhealthy food.
To sum up, it should be mentioned sport is one of the most important part of out life. So, watching news and shows helps people keep focus and motivation on their sport activity.
