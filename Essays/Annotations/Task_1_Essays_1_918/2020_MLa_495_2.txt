There is an opinion that watching sports is a waste of time. I strongly disagree that belief and consider watching sports not only good, but really beneficial leisure activity.
First, watching sports may be a great thing to do as for those who are willing to become professional sportsmen, so for those people who simply enjoy doing sports. For instance, watching sports is an inseparable part of children sports activities: they are usually asked to watch it to learn from professionals, to find admiration and motivation in them. School teams can watch the plays of professional teams to learn their strategies, or borrow some elements from professionals.
Second, live sports events unite people and give them an unforgettable feeling of connection and cohesion. It is true especially for international championships such as Olympic games, football world cups or water sports championships, when fans from all over the world come to support their home teams and to enjoy the honest and beautiful competitions. Big sport events last for at minimum several weeks, hence, for this time people sharing the common interest in sports stay together, exchanging their cultures.
The last, but not the least, is that watching sports can be another way for people to recieve the emotions they seek for. One-to-one and team competitions are thrilling: they can give people a dose of adrenaline, make them experience joy, disapointment and many other feelings. Hymnastics and synchronized wimming are fascinating performances giving spectaculars the sense of beauty and delight.
Jumping into conclusion, I would like to say that watching sports is much more than simple watching. Sports events are usually bright and full of emotions. This is a way to learn, to experience emotions, as well as to communicate and feel life and those around you.
