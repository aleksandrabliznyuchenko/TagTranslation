Many sport events such as football competitions, are not only attract people to watch them on stadiums, but also they attract broad audience by broadcasting on TV. Although there exists an opinion that watch sports is a waste of time, I do not agree with this point of view and strongly believe that it is a good way to spend free time. To begin with, some types of sports form big fan bases, which can be considered as subcultures. It means that people who like to watch, for example, football or hockey, are a part of wide social network. For this reason, sport fans can communicate with people, who share their passion, and make friends all over the world. It does not matter if person is able to visit live events or not, he/she will always have something to discuss with others. Next, the person's desire to watch his/her favorite sport in real life can force his/her to travel. So, it becomes not only an opportunity to experience the spirit of real life sport event, where many people express their full support to their favorite sportsmen or sport teams, but also an opportunity to broad their knowledge by open a new culture. Furthermore, I suppose that watching sports can stimulate people to do more sports by themselves, which is quite useful for their health. In addition, for many people watching sports is the simplest way to relax after a difficult working day.
For the reasons mentioned above, I suppose that watching sports cannot be considered as a waste of time, because of it gives to people opportunity to communicate, travel and motivates to improve their health and relax.
