It is believed by some that watching sport events, both live and televised, is pointless. I have to disagree with this opinion and in this essay I will provide the reasoning behind my point of view.
First and foremost, sports is incredibly important in people's lives. It is a great source for entertainment and leisure. People watch sports (and even do it) for relaxation, because of the fact that some adore competitions, to get excited for something - there are incredibly many ways as to why people may enjoy sports, and it cannot be a waste of time if it is a part of someone's life. People get strongly invested in their favorite sports, they cheer for their favorite performers and it means a tremendous lot to them. For some, it may even be a way to forget about the reality while indulging in what they love the most.
In addition, some people have chosen sports as a career path. Without those who attend their games or watch them on TV, they would simply not have a job. That is because viewers are the main source of income for sportsmen, their managers, the arenas where they play and so forth.
To conclude my arguments, I would like to say that practically no activity may be called a waste of time, regardless of the fact whether one likes it or not. If it is important to some (based on financial reasons or simply because of the joy of it), then it has a right to exist and be valued by them without others belittling the activity.
