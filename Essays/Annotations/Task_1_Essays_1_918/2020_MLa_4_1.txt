Social media has played a central role in the human society from early 2010s. One incredibly popular network at the time was Facebook.
In 2012 Mark Zuckerberg's creation already had about 150 million desktop users and 67 million mobile users. These numbers changed a year later with approximately 30 million more people logging in from their phone app. Consequently this is followed by a 20 million decrease in desktop users on Facebook, as many of them probably switched to mobile. Other than the survey about preferences in devices to use, research on reasons for using this particular network has been carried out. It showed that the main reasons for women were sharing pictures and seeing entertaining and humorous publications on the site. The male population seemed to consider receiving updates and sharing photos as two equally important reasons of their choice of Facebook. Another less significant, although considered among the main ones, reason is learning about ways to help others.
