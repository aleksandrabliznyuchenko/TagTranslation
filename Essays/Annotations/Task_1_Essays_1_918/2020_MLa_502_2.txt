With a constantly increasing popularity of sports and therefore a number of sports fans, many people nowadays believe that watching sports is a useless leisure activity. This essay will argue that following sport events both on TV or alive is not a complete waste of time. To the contrary, it may help amateur sportsmen to improve their skills and let people of different social groups join together.
It comes as no surprise that a lot of sports fans do not only watch sports translations, but also do their favourite kind of sport themsleves. For non-professional sportsmen watching professionals doing sports may become an excellent tutorial and source of information. Since plenty of amateurs cannot afford to hire their personal professional couch to train with, they learn how to perform the tricks by watching and repeating the sportsmen's actions. For instance, successful football matches of Lionel Messy revealed his special techniques and pretty effective winning strategies that the growing sportsmen can also adjust and use.
Besides, sports provides a spirit of unity for millions of people and helps them find each other and make friends. Apparently, sports is extremely popular worldwide, which makes it available for fans of various ages, nations, and incomes. Fans' attributes and symbols are absolutely free for anyone to follow, translate and support. Likewise, fans' culture gives an opportunity for people of different backgrounds to unite and feel precious. The world history remembers a lot of bright examples of international marriages and friendships that started because two complete strangers just met at the sports event or were the fans of the same baseball team, for example.
To sum up, watching sports may seem to be a complete waste of time for some people, but I firmly believe that it has many advantages which make it important and useful.
