For the whole history of mankind sport events were important for huge amount of people. From greek Olympic games to Football World Cup sport was an intrument of politics and way of entertainment for average citizens. There are people who consider watching sports as a waste of time. Whereas other people can see benefits in such activity.
To my mind, watching sports is not a waste of time. First of all, I am convinced that we should not judge people for their preferences of leisure activity. For example, sport programs might help some people to forget about their problems for a while and just enjoy the action as any other hobby. Secondly, I consider sports events as an interesting kind of reality show, where nobody can predict the plot and in fair battle the weak one can beat the strongest, bringing miracles in standard way of things. It also can be beautiful, those who consider sport uninteresting have never seen breathtaking jumps of football goalkeepers or athlets. The last but not the least, widescale sport events has an important function of uniting people around their national or local identity. For example, football world cups for the last fifty years turned to be a large festivals in which fans from different countries have a chance to present their culture to foreigners all over the world.
To sum up, I would like to stress that sports events has always been important and desired among different people and we should respect their choice. Sport is a tremendous part of economy and business, and if sport is a waste of time, then what is not? As John Lennon said: "Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time."
