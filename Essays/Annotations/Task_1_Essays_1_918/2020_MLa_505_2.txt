Sport is known to be one of the most popular recreations in the world. A lot of people are fond of watching sports too. However, there are people who believe that it is useless. My viewpoint is that watching sports is a good way to engage and can give one great emotions.
Firstly, watching sports competitions gives full spectrum of emotions one cannot receive in daily life. No matter how you are watching it - live on stadium or in front of the TV - you will inevitably feel excitment of winning or regretment of losing. Both can be so strong that they will not let you for some time. Secondly, it is a great sourse to find friends with whom you can share your emotions. For example, if you are on a live sport event, even strangers can be a way to express your feelings which is a very good psychological trick for mental health. Sport events are perfect to give yourself a chance to scream outloud with others. Thirdly, there can be numerous cases which prevent one from joining professional sport, particularly, lack of experiance or invalid health condition. Nevertheless, they can enjoy your favourite kind of sport anytime and still get experiance. For instance, children who go on sports matches can find out that they want to be like those sportsmen in future, and that is how new trainees are formed.
To conclude, I am sure that watching sports is absolutely not a waste of your time since you gain a lot from it like bright emotions and new friendship ties.
