There are two graphs. The first one depicts the use of Facebook during 2012-2013 years, while the second shows the main purposes for using this social media.
It is noticable that the preferences on how people usually spend their time in Facebook have slightly changed. In 2012 desktops were the main device to search the Facebook. However, by 2013 the number of people who use the mobile version of Facebook has increased up to about 100 millions of users. Nevertheless, the majority of people still use the desktop application.
Talking about the reasons, 54 persentages of men use Facebook for publishing their photos or videos, while the main reason for women (to be more precise, 39 persentages) to use it is both receiving updates and searching for humorous posts. Overall, we can see the great difference between female and male users, despite the fact that men also wait for updates scrolling the Facebook.
