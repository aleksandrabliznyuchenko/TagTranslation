There is an opinion that no matter how a person watches sports, i.e., on TV or visiting different sports matches offline, it is in both cases a useless past-time. Personally, I cannot agree with this statement and now I will explain my position.
First of all, most kinds of sports give an opportuity for everyone to express their emotions fully. The reason behind that is because everyboby starts feeling the same stress and tensions as proffesional sportsmen who performing their skills during the sports events. For example, there is a well-known fact that a majority of men are highly emotional during football matches, because they become the invisble adiitional player in a team and try to support mentally and emotionally their members. If the sport event ends with the winning of their favourite team, then all the fans feel relief and proud, which can be considered as a positive state for human health.
Secondly, someone can be pretty motivated after watching an online or offline sport game. Such people start wishing to became as powerful as the winner. For example, history knows a lot of stories when a little boy or girl became so exited about the sports players that he or she began working hard to one day gain such a success and win the first price. Finally, watching sports programms is much more usefull than just doing noting or spending time on watching some strange contents which internet is full of. At least, sports matches will not be a cause of human's degradation.
To sum up, I would like to stress that sports events is far not a waste of time, because it has quite enough good aspects. Moreover, it should not be a matter of fact how exactly people prefer to spend their own time. We are all differ from each other, and it makes us unusual.
