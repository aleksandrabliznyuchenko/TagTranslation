There is a statement that spending time on watching different kinds of sport is a waste of time. I have 50% agreement and 50% disagreement with that because there are some situiations when it is really wasteful and some when not. Below I describe my thoughts about it.
First of all it is needed to understand the purpose of watching sports. Talking about live sports events it can be relaxing time with family or friends when people go and "scream" for their favourite team. In this case it is not wasting of time, it is a relaxing time after hard work or study. People need to reload for staying energic and balanced. Going to live sports events is a good way to reload and relax. Also, it is important for sportmen because teams like football, baseball, basketball, etc need a support from people. Connection between gamers and watchers make live events more wonderful. Moreover, children can inspire by watching live sports and will want to do it either which is good for their health.
Secondly, examine a situation when watching sports became a habit like every weekend you go to the bar, drink beer and watching football. I suppose it is waste of time and bad for health also. In that case there is no good purpose of watching sports. There are much more other ways to spend weekend healthier and more pleasant, for example, dinner with family or walking with husband or wife or travel to grandparents. It is better for saving home warmness and for mental health also, because you will not waste your life. In conclusion I would like to say that watching sports, espesially live events, is a good entertainment but I think that it should not become a habit.
