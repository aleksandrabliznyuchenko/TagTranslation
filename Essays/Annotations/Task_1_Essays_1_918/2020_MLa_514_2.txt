Nowadays, humanity has more than ever possibilities to entertain itself, and it is obvious that some opinions about various kinds of entertainment may differ. As for the watching sports on TV or on a stadium, some people might find it useless, while others will argue and say that it is a major part of their free time. First of all, watching sports sometimes might be not a wise way to spend one's evening or weekend, because there are more useful ways to entertain yourself. Today's progress offers an unimaginable amount of leisure activities - from Virtual Reality games to skydiving in an aerotube. A person can even play a sport than watching it, because it surely will be more useful for their health and brain. Despite that, people may still prefer to watch sports instead of playing it because of various reasons. They may not be physically able to perform any given activities, so the one thing left for them is to watch and support players from a distance.
Secondly, watching sports might be perceived as a waste of time in case if someone appreciate to spend time with the loved ones. Furthermore, it is obvious, that time spent with family, friends or a parther is the most precious of all. So a person definitely should not waste it watching sports on TV or wherever else. On the other hand, watching sports can have special value for someone, who decided to dedicate her/his free time to it. It is possible, that one used to watch sports with his or her father, who is now no longer alive, so now it is a warm memory.
Personally, i prefer not to judge people by their ways of spending some free time as long as it is safe for everyone around. That is why i have a neutral position according to the stated question.
In conclusion, there is a great amount of ways of entertainment, including watching sports on TV or on a stadium. People will always have as many opinions as possible, so that is why everyone can find a leisure activity they please the most.
