It is widely believed that spending time on watching sport competition on TV or in the real life on stadiums is a loss of time. To a certain extent I agree with this statement, however, I also think that watching sport programs can be useful.
Spending time watching sports can be considered as a waste of time because usually sport matches are not so entertainment, especially football or hockey on TV. It is widely-spread situation when two teams do not score goals during the whole game and after the final siren fans go home or turn off the TV chanel with a big regret, since they spent their time and money, but did not see the goals, at least one. During these two or more hours people can do more useful things than just sitting in front of TV screen and watching boring game. However, the technological development allows us to watch the game in the record or we can spend ten minutes for watching the best moments of the game.
On the other hand, watching sports, especially at live events, has a positive side, in tems of spending time. Sport unites diffrent people from different social classes and spheres of human activity. When you arrive at the huge stadium and take you place, during the game a person who sits near to you can become your friend, because you will discuss the match, sing the hymn of your club, eat hotdogs and drink something and after the game you will receive not only a fantastic emotions but also a friend. For example, three years ago I visited the football game of Zenit and at this game I met a person with whom I still communicate.
For the reasons mentioned before I think that spending time on watching sports can be considered as a waste of time, however, at the same time I believe that this type of activity has some positive and beneficial effect.
