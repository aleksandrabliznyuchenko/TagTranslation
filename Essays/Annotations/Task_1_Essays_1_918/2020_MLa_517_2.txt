Recently, the public interest surrounding the question of whether watching sports is a waste of time has risen significantly. Personally, I disagree with the fact that when people watch sports either on TV or live they are wasting their time. In this essay I will provide some arguments to prove my opinion.
Firstly, it is one of the activities which people can do with their families or friends. Unfortunately, sometimes relatives or good friends rarely meet each other, due to having no special occasion. In both cases watching sports either on TV or live is a perfect reason to gather together and share a good time. Moreover, in some families or groups of friends it is a kind of tradition to watch sports in front of a big screen with some snacks. In this situation people watch sports events not only for watching but to share their emotions with their close people.
Secondly, attending sports events is a unique opportunity when people are able to express the emotions to the whole stadium, when they are wathcing football, for example. Besides, it is a perfect activity to relax after a hard day and drop out from the daily routine. Moreover, in live sports events it is possible to get an amazing feeling of unity, being a part of a big team of spectators which supporst a certain team or sportsman.
Taking everything into account, it is fair to say that this issue remains to be a subject of a lively debate. Nevertheless, I trully believe that watching sports is woth doing activity.
