The graph gives information about how the use of Facebook changed in a one year period and illustrates the main reasons for men and for women to use this platform.
Overall, it is possible to see that desktop as a device for Facebook became less popular, meanwhile the mobile phone became used more frequently for this platform. Besides, three of four reasons introduced on the graph are shared by higher amount of women rather than men, except for the one, which stands for "receiving updates".
First of all, it is noticeable that overall usage of mobile phone is lower in any time period in comparison to the desktop. However, the share of users of the latter slightly decreased in 2013 from approximately 150 millions to almost 140 millions. As for the mobile phones, their usage almost doubled from nearly 60 millions to approximately 100 millions users.
Second of all, speaking of the reasons why people use Fasebook, it is possible to state that women use this platform to share photos and videos more than men: 54% of females agreed on this issue, meanwhile only for 39% of males this point is reasonable. "Seeing funny posts" was also chosen by higher amount of women (with the figure of 43%) in comparison to 35% of men.
