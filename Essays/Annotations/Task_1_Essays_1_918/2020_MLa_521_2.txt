According to some people, spending free time by watching a particular sport is killing time which can be spent on much better activities. However, I disagree with this statement as I suppose it is a beneficial activity and can be useful for any person.
To start with, one can learn about such important things as game team spirit and cooperation while watching team games in his or her free time. Such games show an incredible example of team spirit which can be applied in our daily activities. To add more, it is impossible to know more about the sports without watching on a big screen how masters are doing it. Also, it is a good way to spend leisure time with family members or friends. Supporting one team may bring people closer and give a possibility to discuss many aspects of a game and players. Hence, watching sports have numerous benefits to every person.
Watching sports can motivate people to be more fit and become engaged in some particular sports. By trying to copy sports role models, people start having a healthy lifestyle and sometimes become more fit. For example, my sister's husband was inspired by watching football as a teenager, and later on became a captain of a football team at his university. There are many stories like this which leads to a statement that even a passive way of contributing to sports can have beneficial outcome for a person.
In conclusion, watching sports in free time has advantages for people, and sometimes can even lead to choosing a career path. So, instead of complaining about bad effect of sitting in front of the screen, people can encourage others become more interested in sports and participate in it if there is a possibility.
