There is a popular point of view that watching sports and not doing it is just wasting of time and it is not important. I can not agree with this opinion because i concider watching sports as important part of and sport in general and people daily life. Firstly, watching sport games, events is the way to relax. These programms can be very interesting and exciting. Sometimes while sitting at home and choosing what to watch it is not bad to decide to spend a night with some sport game and not movie. For example my dad likes to watch basketball after long day at work. And for him it is the way to relax. I think it cannot be concidered as wasting of time. Secondly, watching sport games can be educating. It can help and professional sportsmen - they can find more information about their competitors, style of their games, also they can find more interesting tips for their own sport life. It can help children to know more about sport they want to participate, about their favorite sportsmen. Also it can be useful for people who just want to know more. For example i read about baseball and i understood almost nothing. But after watching this game on the Youtube everything became clear. So, it does not exclude real sport from person's life, it just extend knowledge about it.
I am sure that every task, hobby, spending time is important and can give something good to person and can no be just a way to waste time. Especially when we are talking about sport - deep and interesting theme.
