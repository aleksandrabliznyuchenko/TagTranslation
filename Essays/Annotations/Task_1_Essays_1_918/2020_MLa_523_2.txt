Many people are of the opinion that watching different sport matches on TV or at the sport fields is a useless action. I agree with this statement because it is not included any useful knowlege or health for the organism, a lot of people doing this with unhealthy quick snacks and the last reason is about a violance in some sports that can have an psychological influence.
Firstly, the wasting time of watching entertainment proggrams does not bring any food for brains. It will be better to read a book or being involved into any online course for acquisition of knowledge. Those people who folow various sport events do it not by themselves but only by their support of a team or a player. Such activity cannot help anyone phisically.
Secondly, most people eat dangerous food for our body during the footbal, hokey, tennis or other matches. These snacks are high in fat, sugar and salt that leads to problems with a person's health. An example of such desease is obesity - one of the most popular problem of the 21st century.
And finaly the last but not the least, almost every sport especially for men's choice connected with the violance. It has an psychological effect that have an hazardous causes such as domestic violence or overtly abusive behaviour. Such maltreatment provides unhappy families and the increasing of the level of divorses in a country. The last one plays significant role in statistics of any country.
To conclude, I agee with the opinion that watching TV proggrames about sport or visiting matches is an empty spending the time. Such activity is useless for our brains, unhealthy for our health because of eating fast food or snacks and risky for psychological state about abusive behaviour.
