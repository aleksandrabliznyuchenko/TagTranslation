The presented bar charts show the comparison of the amounts of Facebook users utilizing desktop and mobile phone in 2012 and 2013 as well as the rationale of this social network usage by men and women. Generally, it is evident that the use of Facebook on desktops is higher than the one of mobile in both years and both genders use it mainly for sharing photos and videos.
Moving to the details, we can see the decrease in the amount of desktop users by 2013 and the drastic rise in mobile usage on the contrary. Moreover, the second bar graph depicts that a little above a half of male respondents and more of a third of females use Facebook for sharing their experience through pictures/videos. However, the least popular reason for using the portal is finding ways to help people and it is seen by the proportions which are the ones of the lowest for both genders.
