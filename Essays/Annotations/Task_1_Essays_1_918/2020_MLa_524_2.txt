There is an opinion that it is useless to visit sports events or watch it through a TV. I strongly disagree with this statement because both ways of participating in sports have beneficial aspects for viewers.
Firstly, watching sports programs on TV has advantages in both immaterial and material ways. Obviously, some people just do not have an access to sport events even thought they might have passion in it. TV sport live shows help not only to save money from the tickets but also to have a possibility to "participate" in an event that may be thousands miles away from you. It is convenient and interesting because viewers can find out new facts and information out of commentator's speech and develop their life views. Moreover, some may reveal their interest in particular sport area and get a new hobby that is good for their health.
Secondly, even though it is cheaper to watch television broadcasting of sports games, some people just want to feel the energy and the atmosphere of a place and see everything in live conditions. They like to be a part of an experience of ups and downs of their favourite sportsmen as well as to be able to see everything without troubles with the connection or enormous dosages of advertisement. In addition, such way of entertainment is a good chance to find new friends and relax from the working routine. In conclusion, people are not wasting time when watching sports live or via TV programs. Both ways help to get a rest, find something new and interesting for themselves.
