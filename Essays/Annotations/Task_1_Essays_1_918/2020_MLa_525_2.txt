From the acient times the various sport activities have been an important part of the existing social order as the subject of the major public attention and the way to express power. In contemporary world it still provides people with a relatively passive leisure activity that is often critisised for its character.
There are several functional features of wathcing sports considered socially important by me that allow us to consider it legitable. Firstly, the specific culture around this sort of consumption gives individuals a strong feeling of "something bigger" and thus supports them in difficult life situations. The phenomena of fans movements is related to this collective action (sociological concept suggested by Max Weber) as well: by recognizing each other, fans become a community with its positive consequences. Further, any sport may provide a spectator with a wide range of emotions despite of its popularity and type (collective or individual). Although these emotional reactions might be exausting, it is valuable to express them from time to time. Even a presumably boring chess tournaments are the sources of inspiration for thausands of people (especially if we consider rapid or blitz time controls).
On the other hand, the discussed consumption practice may be called a waste of time because of the "alternative cost" usually depicted as reading books, self studing, and so on. The strength of this argument is its individualistic character: the critique of the leisure activity is in fact a critique of a particular person's lifestyle. This reference is not relevant as far as each individual decides solely weather to watch sport or not and shares this responsibility alone. At least, it is impossible and even harmful to avoid safety leisure.
So, I do not see a problem in watching sport as a potential form of leisure. It brings people together and present them the emotions they might have not experienced yet what is great.
