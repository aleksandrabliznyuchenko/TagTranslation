It is often said that watching sport events, whether live or on TV, is a complete waste of time. However, there are people who disagree with that point of view and believe that engaging in a hobby does not need to be productive. While I favor the latter notion, there exist a number of convincing arguments for supporting both of the points of view.
Some people indeed regard watching sports as a useless activity. To them, there is no point in taking interest in a game or event unless you are the one taking part in it. As it is important to engage in physical activity in one's life, people who like watching sports are often encouraged to "get up from the couch" and partake in the sport rather than watch other people doing it. They are often seen as lazy by the others for choosing this particular hobby as well.
However, there exists another point of view. Watching sports can be seen as a hobby that does not require the person participating in it to play the sport themselves. Many enjoy the competitive elements of such sport games as football and hockey, and it can be thrilling and emotional to root for athletes participating in championships. This perspective treats watching sports as a more leisurly activity, similar to watching an entertaining movie.
Both of these opinions are rather valid. However, I agree with the notion that watching sports is not a waste of time. To my mind, anything a person enjoys can be considered useful for them personally, and as long as they are having fun and not causing any trouble they should not be berated for enjoying a particular hobby.
