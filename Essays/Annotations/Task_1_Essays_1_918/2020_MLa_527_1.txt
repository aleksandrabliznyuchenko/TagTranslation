Overall, it can be noticed that the popularity of mobile version of Facebook has a notable increase in March 2013 compared to the last year. In addition, it is to be said that women do prevail in most of the reasons presented on the second graph If we look at the first graph, we will see that the usage of mobile version has increased in 2013. Specifically, in a relatively small period on one year the number of users has increased from 45 to 100. But we still need to understand that mobile version is still not as sufficient as desktop version because of the great difference in number of users presented on the graph.
When it comes to reasons, women prevail in most of the categories. For instance, we can notice that females tend to share photos much often compared to men - 54% vs 39%. Also, it is interesting that the same percentage of males and females uses Facebook for receiving updates.
