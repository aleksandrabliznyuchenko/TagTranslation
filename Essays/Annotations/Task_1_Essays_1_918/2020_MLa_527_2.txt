With the digitalization of society people started to use TV and internet to watch sport events much often rather than going and experiencing it in a real life setting. Some people tend to argue that digital type of leisure is just a waste of time and I do not agree with them. In the following text, i will provide several arguments supporting my opinion.
First of all, I believe that watching sport events on TV or at live sport events is much more comfortable for the majority of people. My point is connected with the fact that many individuals who are interested in sports are usually working people who cannot visit stadiums or other places due to the lack of free time. Since online events are recorded it is much easier for the mentioned category of people to watch their loved events later when they have an oppurtunity to do that.
In addition, I think that by watching such events in online form it will be easier to make family members closer together because of shared leisure time. Here my argument refers to the dimension of time as well. I suppose that in a modern times people are much concerned with various responsibilities: some need to work, others are busy with their education and so on. So, from time to time it is complicated to just gather together and enjoy the moment. I suggest that watching online sport events can be a solution here because as i mentioned earlier recorded events can be watched in any time of the day.
To conclude, while i understand that some people consider digital type of leisure to be just a waste of time, i strongly believe that it can be rational and even useful.
