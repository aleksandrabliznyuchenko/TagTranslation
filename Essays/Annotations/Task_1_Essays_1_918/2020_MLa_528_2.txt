There is an opinion sports-related content is not worth watching. I agree with it only to a certain extent and in what follows, I will explain what it is about this idea that I agree and disagree with.
I would like to start by saying that, as I see it, watching sports can be considered a waste of time becuse it implies that an individual does not get any information from it that could contribute to his/her intellectual development. I think, watching sport-related content usually serves mainly entertainment purposes. In regards to that, I believe that it is important to admit that consuming not informative, amusing content is necessary sometimes, since people need to intellectually relax and cannot always be productive. Therefore, if a person is involved in intellectual activity or has other kind of difficult work to do, it is normal for such a person to watch something relaxing and, for some people, sports suit this category.
However, I believe that watching sports is, indeed, a waste of time when people are generally not involved in intense thinking processes and intellectual activities, yet they consume a lot of entertaining content, including sport. This way, they spend their time watching something that does not stimulate their development and, thus, actually waste their time that they could have spent on something useful and informational.
To sum it up, I agree with this opinion only when it comes to people who consume sports-related content alongside other entertaining content. But if it is a way to relax for people who consume some informational content otherwise, I would not necessarily consider it a waste of time.
