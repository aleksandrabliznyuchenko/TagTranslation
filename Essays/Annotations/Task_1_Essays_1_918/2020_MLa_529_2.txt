Human activity, such as sport and exercising make person more healthier and happier. Yet, modern people are more likely to visit sport event or watch a soccer match on TV, rather than exercises by themselves. Some people believe that following sport events and watching them on TV are useless for the everyday life and consider that a clear waste of time. Nevertheless, I would not agree with that statement, no matter how logical and provocative might that sound.
Watching sport event live or at home does not make person healthier or helps to stay in fit. However, it provides a great opportunities to start exercising on a regular base.
The main advantage of watching sport is that this may encourage you to practice sport and developing needed skills to succeed in your favourite activity. The clear example is the popularity of soccer in Russia, especially among children, which attend to matches and watch them online and playing football at the backyard all they long, while wearing T-shirts with the names of their most-loved players. This is obviously improving their physical condition. Hundreds of sport-professionals came to the industry after beloved champion, that they have seen on TV.
The second most important benefit is related to psyhological specialties of particular person. Ones like watching sports as it helps them to relax after hard work (because we are extremely stressful nowadays), others perceive sport as a life lesson of how to accept victory and how to deal with difficulties.
All in all, watching sport events is not a waste of time, as long as person is able to use received experience in an everyday life and improve it That is a great way to deal with a stress, improve sport habits ad find a new friens.
