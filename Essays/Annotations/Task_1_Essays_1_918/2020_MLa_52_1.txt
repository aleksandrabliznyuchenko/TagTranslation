There are 2 pictures given with different charts with information about people's device preferences on using Facebook from 2012 to 2013 and the purposes to do that according to their sex.
First of all, let's discuss the first picture. As we can see according to the charts, in 2012 people used to scroll Facebook using their computers or laptops rather than mobiles: about 150 million users prefered desktops and only 57 million users would use their mobile phones However, the situation had changed in 2013 as the mobile usage had risen to 98 million users and the desktop usage had fallen to 138 million users. Describing the second picture, Charts show us that posting your content is the most preferable reason to use Facebook among both sex. About 54% of asked men had chosen "sharing photos/videos" as a reason for surfing Facebook comparing to 39% of women. The same percentage of men and women (39%) had chosen "receiving updates" as a reason for using Facebook. About 43% of men thought, that the meaning to scroll Facebook is to see funny posts and only 35% of women would do that. "Learning about ways to help others" is the most unpopular purpose to visit Facebook: Only 35% of men had chosen that reason comparing to 25% of women.
