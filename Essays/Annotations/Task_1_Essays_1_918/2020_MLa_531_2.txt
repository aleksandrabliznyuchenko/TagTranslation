It is argued by some people that watching sprots programmes is a waste of time. I competely disagree with this opinion and in this essay I will state the reasons for holding my view.
The most compelling reseason to my view is that some people watching sports programmes as they hobby, they like different kinds of sports. This people get a real pleasure from watching sports on TV or at live sports events if they had an opportunity for that. Some of them might like to play football with their family, friends and colleages, but because of lack of the time the only way to somehow experience it is to watch sports on TV.
Another reason is that some people watching sports to expand their horizons or to be aware about things that happens in the ''sport world''. In the modern world it is important to be aware, to have some kind of knolewdge in different topics of lives, because you never know when this knoweldge will help you in the future. For example, when you go out with your friends or you in public place with unknown people and they start to speak about sports, you can easily join to their conversation and at the end of day you can make some usefull contact.
Last reason is that due to the situation that happend in the world (a word pandemic because of coronavirus), everyone was izolated and social distancing. And in this period it was impossible to go out in public place, everyone was at home and the only thing that people could make is to watch TV or self-educated. So, watching sports programmes was not a waste of time, people watched it to relax, to have fun or forgot in a momet about bad things that happend and get a possitive emotions from watching sport.
In conclusion, I would like to say that while the both views are commonly held in society, I think that watching TV programmes is not a waste of time if people really enjoy this procces and not spent all thime on TV. Watching sports can be usefull because you learn new things and expand your horizons.
