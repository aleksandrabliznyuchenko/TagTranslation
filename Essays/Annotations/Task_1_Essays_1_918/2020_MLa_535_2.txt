Some people consider watching different sports is a waste of time. However, I disagree with that point of view because I am sure that watching sports contribute to a healthier lifestyle among viewers, team spirit and, what is more, help to relieve stress after work.
To start with, watching the game is a great opportunity to relax after hard day and spend your free time with our favourite people. Also, watching sports on TV or at live sports events is a good way for individuals to get together and cheer for their team's victories. Such people may be from various cultures, have different social status in life and also religious beliefs, but nothing matters at these moments, except for team spirit. To give a clear example, I would mention my boyfriend and his friend that have rather different roots. Nevertheless, when they meet up to watch sports, they forget about everything and become like a close unit.
In addition, watching such sports events inspires people to stay fit and be in a good health. Teenagers are also fans of some sports stars and tend to live physically active lives as them. For instance, I used to watch basketball on TV with my dad when I was younger. After some time it encouraged me to go in for sports and by now I have achieved several gold medals in karate.
To conclude, I would like to say that watching sports is obviously not a waste of time. It connects people with diverse cultures and have a positive impact on people as they are encouraged to stick to a healthy way of life.
