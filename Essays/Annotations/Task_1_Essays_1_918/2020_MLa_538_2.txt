Some people argue that sport shows and events are time consuming to watch via TV. In my point of view, this statememt is truthful. There are many reasons why it is a waste of time - missing of pesonal bonding and less movements.
Firstly, it is known that people tend to stick to blue screens of TV sets more often nowadays, so it can have an impact on social interaction and overall life of average person. By not going to sports event in real life people can miss an opportunity to find a person to bond with. The experince of loss or gaining while watching event in a huge group of fans may help a person to find new friendship or mutually bond with people. There are numerous example of such effect - many fan couples and friendships found each other while watching games and tournaments in arenas.
Secondly, rather than sittiing on the sofa near TV sports lover can move around via travelling, standing in the line and show their excitment on group by jumping and screaming. Less physical activity may crucailly impact someones health. Howerver, moving around to travel to the event destination may help a sports lover to stay fit because to be in the destination place requires to walk and even sometime to hop to find a seat. Visiting tournament may help to spend more energy while sofa option may only cause health broblems such as obesity and diabetes.
To sum up, I agree with a statement than wasting time by watching sports events on TV thay can bring new experince by watcing them in real life. This behavior can benefit in various aspects: rather than sitting a person will be able to have a physichal activity and even find a new person to interst with and develop relationship.
