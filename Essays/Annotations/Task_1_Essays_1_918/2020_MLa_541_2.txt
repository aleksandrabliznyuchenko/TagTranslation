Nowadays, most sport games have a huge number of fans and lovers. Some people believe that watching sports is a waste of time. Others go to games every weekend or watch it on TV. I personally totally see only positive sides of watching sports.
First of all, the most compelling reason for holding to my view is that sports is an educational activity just like going to a theatre or a museum. Sport are developing supervisory skills as it requires a high level of attentiveness to keep abreast with the game. In addition to it, people who are watching the game can be inspired to play the game themselves even who are not into sports and who could not less about games I believe also find an appealing aspects.
Another reason for my position is that watching sports can be psychologically relaxing. Cheering your favourite team either on the stadium together with hundreds of other fans or at home on cosy couch helps people to ease up after a long week at work or university. Also people can spend time with your friends or relatives who are also keen on similar sport game. Moreover, nothing compares to being a passive part of the team cheering players from grandstand, being in one spirit with total strangers who came for the same reason is an unbelievable feeling and person should experience this at least once in their life. In conclusion, i totally disagree with the statement. Wether one comes to support the team of their preference ot one is indifferent and comes for the experience both will end up being satisfied with decision to watch sports. Given the above, I consider that everyone should go to a game or watching it on TV at leat once in their life.
