As it is possible to figure out from the first chart, people tended to use Facebook mostly in desktop version in 2012-2013 years, the mobile version was not actually popualr among people. It deserves mentioning that in 2013 there was a tendency to use Facebook on mobile version (nearly 100 millions of users chose a mobile version in 2013 in comparison with about 60 millions users the year before).
Describing the second chart, it is relevant to say that women were more active social users than men. More than a half of women while surfing the Facebookd were sharing photos and videos while only 39% of men did the same thing. Also women were more likely to learn about the ways to help others as one third of women did it while only 25% of men were spending their time this way.
The charts let see the main tendencies in Facebook users habits and understand which channels were used to consume the social network content during 2012-2013 years.
