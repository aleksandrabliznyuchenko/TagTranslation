It goes without saying that sport plays an important role on people's lives. To my mind, watching sport is a great way to spend time. To start with, watching sport provides people with a wonderful opportunity to go away from the daily routine and have a rest after a hard study or work day (or even week). It is also a good way to swithch the attention from life problems to another activity and let the brain recharge. Let me provide an example. My friend really likes watching live sport events: he goes to the staduim weeklly. Once he said that after the event he was the happiest person in the world.
To continue with, watching sports usually makes people feel the sense of belonging to some community (fan club) or a sport team. Healthy addiction to sport watching gives people a chance to find new friends or even soulmates. To prove that, I'd like to point out that my uncle found his close friend while both of them were watching a football match at a sport bar.
However, some people are sure that watching sports just kills people's time. Such people say that watching sports does not help a person to develop himself or herself, it is just the way to waste a time. Also, people who are against watching sport events, usually say that sport events are very dinamic and they do not let a person to calm his or her mind.
To my opinion, watching sports provides people with a full range of emotions and makes their lives more interesting. Self-development should not be associated only with new knowledge or physical activity: it is also about understanding what exactly makes people happy. Watching sport events may help in answering important questions.
To sum up, I'd like to say that people may watch sports not only in order to to spend a free time and have a rest, but also in order to understand themselves better. Watching sports as well as any interesting activity broadens the horizons and make lives better.
