Sport always was one of the most important parts of the life for a lot of people. Some people like doing sports by themselves while the others prefer just watching. Some pople are sure that the second option has nothing in common with sport itself and it is just the waste of life. But I can not agree with this point of view.
First of all, we can not say that watching sport events has no sence as it is a great opportunity for millions of people to get together and spend their free time with lots of pleasure. And I think that sometimes it is really important for everyone just to forget about all the problems and have some fun with friends as it really fulls us with much of new srength to carry on working and solving the problems of our lives. For example, in our country it is really popular among the men to meet with freind for watching football or other kinds of sport after work. And from my point of view it really helps them to keep their mental helth and, therefore, keep great relationships in their families.
Moreover, this kind of having rest help people to share their amotions and get rid of the bad ones. As an example, usually when people watch football they feel relly nervous about the their favourite team and began shouting in so called "dangerous" moments. That helps them to express all the emotions they have inside and become more calm after the game.
In conlusion, there are two very controvercial points of view on not doing sports by yourself but just watching it and both of them to have their chance to exist. But from my point of you watching sports is absolutely not a waste of time as it has lots of benefits.
