Currently, according to some people, spending free time by watching a particular sport is just wast of free time. However, I disagree with the position. In my opinion, it is a very useful activity, that has some benefits of its own.
First of all, when people watch some sports in their free time, they can feel several things such as team spirit. More than that, while watching sport activity, we can gain new knowledge about the game. In other words, we can grow in sports not only during the doing sports themselves, but also while observing the technique and skill of others. For example, when we watch a football, we can research new types of tricks. Thus, watching sports activity has many benefits that can really help us in life and on almost every sphere of it.
Turning to other side of the argument, watching sports events either on television or at live can inspire someone to making great things. In other words, athletes can show through his achievements that a person's capabilities are really limitless. For instance, the captain of the Russian national football team Andrey Arshavin once inspired hundreds of children to sports and even life achievements with winning. So, there are plenty number of stories where a particular sport has inspired people.
To sum ip, it has to be agrees that watching sports in any time is a good way of spending it and for some people this hobby may even turn into professional career and life way. So, there is no doubt that people could watch sport events and encourage their children to develop interest in sport through it.
