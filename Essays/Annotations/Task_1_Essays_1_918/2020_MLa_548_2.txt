Nowadays, it seems that watching sports is not worse our time. Some people think that watching sport is a hobby, which I agree. But others convinced that it is a waste of time. In my opinion, watching sports is a fun pastime First of all, live sport events is the same thing that live music concerts. You can fell the atmosphere of the competition, share your emotions with other fans. This is the unique sense of unity. Secondly, watching sports on TV is a good way to spend some free time at home with your family. Children watching sports can catch a dream to become a sportsmen too. Also sport teaches them never to give up and always do your best.
From the other hand, watching sports is not always a good idea. Some people believe that instead of watching we should actually do sports. They think that lying on the couch you won't get anywhere. You should run in the park or go to gym and work hard instead of watching how others do it. Watching does not make you healthy, it is just a waste of time I disagree with this point of view because watching how others overcome obstacles can be inspiring. Moreover, you can learn a lot of new information about history of different sports, their roles and life stories of sportsmen.
in conclusion I'd like to tell that everyone have their interests. However, I believe that watching sports no matter where worth your time and attention.
