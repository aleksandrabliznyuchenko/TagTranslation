The diagrams below illustrate how and why men and women used Facebook from 2012 to 2013.
Overall, the first chart shows that in March in 2012 150 millions of Facebook users were surfing this media from their computer. It is 20 millions of users more than in March next year. Talking about mobile phones, comparing with March 2012, the number of people using mobiles in 2013 has dramatically risen in almost half.
Let us look at the reasons for using Facebook among men and women. Among almost all categories the percentage of women is more than of men, except for the "receiving updates" where the it was the same (39%). Women were likely to use Facebook to share media (54%) while only 39% of males named it as the main reason. There are two most popular reasons of using this social network among men - sharing media and receiving updates. The less chosen reason among both genders was "learning about ways to help others".
To sum up, there was a less usage of desktops during the year from 2012 to 2013 and the amount of people using mobiles has increased. The most popular reason of using Facebook among females was sharing photos and videos, while among males it was sharing media and receiving updates at the same time.
