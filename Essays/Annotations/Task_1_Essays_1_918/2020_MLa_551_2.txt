There is an opinion that watching sports is rather useless time spending. I totally disagree with this statement and this essay will give arguments and examples for my point of view.
Firstly, it should be understood, that watching sports is a hobby and people do it for the entertainment. Everyone prefers to spend their spare time in the way they enjoy it most. It is not right to judge someone's hobby, because we are all different and have various views on the world. For example, a lot of grandmothers like cooking and learning new receipts and it makes them happy and useful for their children and grandchildren. For someone it might seem to be a waste of time and they prefer to eat out and not spending hours on the kitchen. Nevertheless, for grandmothers there is no aim to eat, when they are cooking, they just want to enjoy themselves and learn something new.
Secondly, some people claimed that watching sports is a waste of time because of an idea that you can just go and do sports whats might be much better and healthier, than sitting in front of the TV. However, a lot of people choose watching sports, but not doing it, because they have a very hard schedual and they do not have physical power for such kinds of hobby as running or any other activities. For instance, after a long day in office cowokers will prefer to go to the bar and watch football to relax and not go playing it.
To conclude everyone should choose hobby they prefer more and depend on their timetable and physical and moral abilities. And how the saying goes "you never waste your time if you enjoy the time you spent".
