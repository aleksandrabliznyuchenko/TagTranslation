Sports always were a big part of human society, but, nevertheless, some people argue that nowadays it is meaningless to spend time on watching sports. I completely disagree with this opinion and in this essay I will state the reasons for my view.
The most compelling reason for holding to my view is that watching sports activities can be as fullfilling and interesting as, for instance, participaiting in them. The excitement from winning yourself can be easily compared with the excitement from watching your favourite team win, and both of these feelings are amazing and worth experiencing.
Another argument that supports my opinion is that the observing of sports events could be a wonderful opportunity to get closer with other people. For example, during a live foorball match a group of friends or a family can root for a certain team together and use the said game as a topic for future conversations.
Lastly, sports watching is a serious business in the modern world, as people tend to make bets on different aspects of the game, such as the winning team or the best player of the match. Bets can be not only a way to make or lose money, but also as a risk factor that makes the sports watching more interesting.
In conclusion, I totally disagree with the statement that people only waste time by watching sports events, as sports unite not only the players, but the audience as well, and by watching such events people can gain new emotions and even money.
