Nowadays, there are people who stand for the opinion that watching sports by different ways is useless. I strongly disagree with this position. To my mind, it is really important and interesting to watch sports. I will try to prove it in next paragraphs.
Firstly, watching sports motivates people to do sport. When humans see other people who are successful in their sphere, they want to reach success too. So if you really enjoy watching sport competitions, you can get inspiration to change your lifestyle and become more sportive and healthy. According to the statistics what I found in one research, 60 percent of women, who made a decision to go fitness centre, started think about sport after watching sport competitions on TV. If watching sports motivates people to care about themselves, it can not be useless.
Secondly, watching sports is a thing that can develop your personality and motivate you to educate something new. When people are interested in something, that help them to learn new information and read more, especially that is right for children. For instance, when I was eight I watched the Olympic Games on TV with my parents. I was a child and I perceived this event like something fantastic and impressive. I started to ask my mother about this event and she gave me a book about the history of Olympic Games. I really liked it and then I started to learn Greece history. So watching sports is a way for children and not only children to find an interesting theme and start educating something.
To conclude, sport is an important part of life. Watching it can change people's mind and lifestyle and make them more versatile.
