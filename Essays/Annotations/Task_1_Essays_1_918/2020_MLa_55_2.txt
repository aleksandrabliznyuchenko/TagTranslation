In this essay i will discuss main reasons for both sides: who think so and not and than will give my personal oppinion.
To start with, some people claim that it is boring to see anything when someone else doing it. For example, they prefer to go the football field and play real football, than to go to the stadium and see how the best players play this game. Moreover, they say that if you have some free time it is better for you to read a book, because such people think that you cannot learn anything from watching sport events, while from book you can take something that will help you in a future.
On the other hand, there are a lot of people who like to watch sports events. Some go to real sports events not only to watch sport event, they go there with friend or family. So they can not only watch game they also can spend time with important people for them. Further, it is unbeliaveble to lern anything all the time, sometime you need not to do anything at all. In addition, professional athlets can motivate people to keep fit.
