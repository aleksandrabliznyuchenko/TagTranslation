Some people believe that watching sports is a waste of their time. And also they say that it does not matter watch sports on TV or at real live events. Now I will try to explain my point of view on this opinion.
I believe that everybody must to have some hobbies and nobody should not to judge them. People need some facilities to make their life more colorful and happier. It means that I disagree with the statement about a waste of time. Of course, I do not talk about the addiction of something (for example TV) because such people change their real life on the virtual world and this is scary. Persons who like watching sport on TV dream about the live sports events and when they get that they have incredible emotions which they can never forget. For example, my father like to spend his time in football games (on TV and real games). I remember this moment when he bought some tickets on the Championship in 2018. He was so impressed by this event which means that watching sports help people to be more exciting of their lives.
Furthermore, such hobbies can escalate into professional activity and became the dream job. Some people do not have the opportunity to practice in special sports school and they improve their skills thanks for matches on TV. And even if such teenagers will not be incredible sportsmen other people could not say that their passion was a waste of time because all happened for a reason. For instance, my friend Max was adopted to great football team because he is a good player but he did not spend money for the training and watched every games on TV.
In conclusion, I may say that all hobbies are necessary. Watching sports or visiting of sports events are not the crime. It is a very important part of people's life and every person should have any hobbies like this.
