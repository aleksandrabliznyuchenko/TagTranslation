For some people it is important to watch sports, while for others it is a useless waste of time. In my opinion, watching sports on TV or being on live sports events has a lot of advantages.
Despite the drawbacks below, the main reason for watching sports is the atmosphere of competition on the screen or in your view. People went to such events not only to see the game, but also to be a part of a huge fan-base of commands or single players. Such expirience brings a lot of pleasant emotions. Moreover, it is a good way to meet with your friends or family members and spend your time together. For some people it is a kind of a long-story tradition. In my liking is to visit some basketball games with my father, since in my childhood it was our happy-day. I adore such events, but also we watch it on TV, if there is no chance for visiting a real event to support our favourite team.
Watching sports is boring for some people. They prefer to replace it by taking a part in a game, not to be a viewer. It cannot be denied that for someone it is more significant to spend this several hours with book or watching a documentary movie to upgrade their knowledge, because watching sports in their opinion does not bring any outcomes.
In conclusion, watching sports is an important part of someone's life, due to it is a part of their traditions. Everyone can spend their time how they want to, it depends only on their preferences.
