Nowadays all of us watchig TV every day and can spend half a day at the sofa. Some of people think that sport channels is easy way to relax. I think that it have 2 ways, positive and negative, lets discass both of this ways.
In one hand, sport channels are develoving us and our horizons. When we watching it, we find out famous players and lern the history. A lot of people have favorite athlete and help him whith support, whiout it sport can not stay in prograss. In this way, when spots is a hobby, i think that watching sports is not waste of time. In other hand, i can tall, that watching TV is basically waste of time, not aviliable which program you see. We spend a lot of time at our mobile phones, i think that it is enough for our health. Our eyes must have more time whithout digital. In this way i agree whith this topic, plus argument is that when we watching TV, we are always like to eat somethig, sport is gambling game, we do not notice how lot we can eat. Of course it is negative influence for our shape.
Summarizing my answer, in greater extent i agree whith this topic. Sports programs have a negative influence for our health and in this way i can say that it is waste of time. But
