It is realy familiar situation wnen people do not anderstand the reason of beeng sport fan and spend time to watching this type of TV or online programs. Others have different opinion, they are sure that spotrs in any expression is the best hobby.
I disagree with the statemet that people can waste their time to do something because it is normal to be happy in different ways. You san do, watch, love or hate sports or any other thing if it is your favourite type of gedonism. Some spotsman have health desiases and it is impossiable to do sports, so they choose another style of their hobby. Also people who live in small cities or do not have anought money can not affort to do special kinds of sport. It is a good replacement to watch favoutite matches on TV or internet. It must be said that watching sports is also a kind of studing. A lot of professional players watch games and analyse them, so it can not be a waisting time. Of course if you are unemployed and do not want to do anything only watch TV with a sport channel, it is a bad idea. But in all other cases watching spors is a wonderful, useful kind of interest.
In conclusion, i would like to repeat my opinion. I am sure that watching sports as fantastic as doing it. I know a lot of smart people who are fans of football, basketball and another kinds of sport matches online. They are not westing time, they are follow theis hobbies.
