Nowadays it is argued by some that watching sport games online or offline is just a waste of time. I completely agree with this opinion and think that there are many ways of spending that time on more interesting and important things. In this essay I will state the reasons for my view.
The most compelling reason for holding my view is that it would be more useful to spend time on doing sport instead of watching it. This is because doing sports makes your body more fitty. Whereas for example watching it on TV brings you some healthy problems with eyes. What is more, doing physical exercises enhances your heart and your immunities as well. As for me, when I had decided to do a little sports every day I felt myself healthier and more resilient.
Another reason for my position is that you could spend time on more cultural wealthy things such as reading books, listening to classic music, going to a theatre, visiting a museum and so on. It will bring you more cultural experience than watching sports. Therefore, you will become more interesting and knowledgeable person. For instance, according to the survey conducted by Moscow State University, more than 87 per cent of people who tries to develop culturally have more interesting lives than others who does not visit any cultural events and not even read books. That means that spending time on more cultural wealthy things will make your life more fully with interesting events.
In conclusion, there is no doubt for me that watching sports just is a waste of time. Because during this time you lose the opportunities to become healthier by doing sports by yourself or become a more cultural wealthy person.
