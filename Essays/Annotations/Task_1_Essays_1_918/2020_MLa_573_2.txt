Nowadays a lot of people choose to spend their free time near the television and watching sports. Some people consider that it is killing your free time, but i disagree with the statement.
First of all, when you watching sports, you can feel the spirit of team, which can motivates you to do sports too, because in team game people try to win the game. Lovers of sports try to follow their idols and go to the same sport, what is very great for human skill. This hobby can even turn into a serious sport career.
More than that, people can gain immense knowledge about sports, while watching it. Also if some members of your family like watching sports too, it can be a great occasion to spend time together near the TV. Cheering together for favourite team brings people closer.
Also, in this way of watching sports channels, people try to attract from their hard work day. It helps relieve stress, when you follow through TV screen on the athletes, who want to effort the win. It mostly suitable for men. They cheering for their loved team and forget about problems.
In conclusion, i would like to say that every person choose how to spend their free time by yourself. Watching sports in leisure time is a good way of spending time with your closer people or for some people sport is a part of life and they gain the skills while they looking at how athletes do. I consider that the main part of people who participating sport in real life like watching the same sport on TV.
