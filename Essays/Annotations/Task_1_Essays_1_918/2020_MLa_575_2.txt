It is a popular belief that sport as a rather popular kind of activity is an integral part of someone life. These people are interested in watching various sport challenges or champions or other events on TV. On the other hand, some people claim that there is no necessary to spend the essential time watching sport games. To my mind, it is a wrong issue.
From my point of view, sport is a widespread hobby of many people from various countries all over the world. Such an activity is a pledge of pleasant lifestyle for people from any age who lead a heathy diet and do sport activities in regular. Other people who does not have a purpose to become leader athlets and not to lead a healthy lifestyle usually may be true fans of this activity. There are numerous sport events every year which can give us an opportunity to gather together and have some pleasure time in a big company. Moreover, I am concerned that various kind of sport activities on TV may help progressive children not to waste their time communicating with friends or parents with the help of modern electronic devices, but play sport games together. Their sedentory lifestyle may lead to different illnesses, heart decisies and other negative consequences, so that at least watching sport on TV may give them motivation to do their best.
However, there is a rather popular point of view that watching numerous sport events on TV is a waste of time. For instance, some people may do necessary work instead of watching TV. And there is an opinion that watching sport on TV is an useless hobby, because you may not be a part of this event.
In conclusion I would like to note that sport on TV is not only a pleasant hobby but an essential and adventure variant of spending leisure time and stimulation to do sport.
