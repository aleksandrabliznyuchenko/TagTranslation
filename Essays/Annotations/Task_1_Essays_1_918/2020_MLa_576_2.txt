It can be argued by some people whether it is a good idea to spend your time by watching sports or not. As for me, I cannot agree with the statement that watching sports is a waste of time. Firstly, watching sports can be beneficial for development of thinking. Many types of sport require having a good strategy in order to be succesful at these sports. People who watch these types of sports can also develop critical thinking. For example, such sports as curling are very intellectual sports because at these sports such qualities as logic, intuition and critical thinking are needed from the players. So, in order to understand the game viewers should also have all the needed qualities.
Secondly, being a sport fan can have a good impact on your social life. For instance, there are plenty of sport fan clubs and social events that can draw together many people from different parts of the world. It is an easy way to find friends at any age and any social status.
Lastly, watching sports can be just a hobby and an enjoyable relaxing activity for some people. It is necessary for people to relax after a long day at work and watching sports is a great way to do it.
In conclusion, although it is discussed by some people that watching sports is not a good and useful way to spend time, I am still convinced that it is a wonderful activity that can have various benefits such as development of many qualities and skills, improvement of social life and way to relax at the end of the day.
