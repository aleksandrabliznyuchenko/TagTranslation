The charts below illustrate the proccess of changing Facebook user's positions among men and women for one year period.
Firstly, there is a trend to change desktop on mobile for using the Facebook. In March 2012 Facebook user's with mobile were less than 60 millions of users, but after a year the number of people using mobile to check Facebook were about 100 millions of users.
Secondly, women prefer to sharing photos, videos and seeing funny posts, while men prefer to receiving updates and sharing photos, videos.
I conclusion, i would like to stress that mobile phone from year to year becomes more and more useful device and people use it to check Facebook. More than that, women and men have different reasons for using Facebook, women like entartainment, while men prefer to receiving updates.
