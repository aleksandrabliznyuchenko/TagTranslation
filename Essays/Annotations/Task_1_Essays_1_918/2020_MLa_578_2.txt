First of all, watching sports can be one of the most useful parts in studying proccess. Children are looking at their parents and want to be their copies, so that if parents watching and loving sports their children will love it too. Sport is very important for children and students, because life without any sport activities or interest can lead to different deseases.
Secondly, the emotions, which you feel at live sports events are unforgettable and amazing. It is no difference between kinds of sport, because all of them bring to you emotions. There are basketball, football, volleyball and a lot of kinds of sport, which you can watching. Emotions can be various, from happy and cheerful to upset and angry. I know that you are living, when you feel emotions. Sport is about emotions and life, that is exectly need to people all ages.
More than that, sport has no limits and you can watching it in your free time, with friends or family. Watching sports can be some kind of a hobby or even proffecional skill. It is person's choice. In conclusion, I would like to stress that I disagree with people, who say that watching sports is a waste of time, because with sport in your life you can take emotions, friends, hobbies and almost make your life more healthier and happier.
