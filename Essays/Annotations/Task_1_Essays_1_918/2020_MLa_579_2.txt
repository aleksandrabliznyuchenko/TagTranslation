Some people consider that watching TV programs is not interesting activity and It is not useful way of spending free time. I believe that sport events and emotional free time is a great way to spend ordinary days. Below i would like to discuss both views on this statement.
On the one hand, various TV programmes can take our time and minds by not useful activity and we lost the real life. We become depended on activity on TV, which is not connected with our lives. Also Such variant of spending time can crush you relationships with close people. For example, when your family does not like spending free time by watching TV programs, you can crush their attitude to you and their mood. It can influence badly in the future.
On the other hand, LIVE SPORT EVENTS CAN DEVELOP OUR MINDS, BECAUSE DIFFERENT GAME IS AN ACTIVITY. DURING THIS TIME OUR MINDS TRY TO THINK CRITICALLY, WE TRY TO REMEMBER INTERESTING MOMENTS. WE RELAX AND DEVELOP OUR MINDS IN ONE SITUATION. ALSO DIFFERENT GAMES GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET RID OFF NEGATIVE EMOTIONS. WE CAN FEEL STRESS BECAUSE OF NERVOUS WORK BUT AFTER SUCH SPENDING TIME OUR MIND AND BODY BECOME CLEAR. THUS, THIS CAN HELP TO LOOK AT OUR PROBLEMS WITH ANOTHER SIDE. FOR INSTANCE, WHEN YOU WATCH THE FOOTBALL MATCH, YOU TRY TO GUESS WHO WILL BE THE WINNER AND WHEN YOUR FAVOURITE PLAYER BECOME A WINNER, YOU MOOD BECOME GOOD AND YOU BECOME INSPIRED. TO SUM UP, WATCHING SPORT IS A GOOD VARIANT TO FEEL BETTER AFTER STRESS MOMENTS IN YOUR LIFE. IT GIVE YOU STRENGHT TO REACH BIG AIMS AND SHOW SIGNIFICANT RESULTS IN DIFFERENT SPHERES OF YOUR LIFE.
