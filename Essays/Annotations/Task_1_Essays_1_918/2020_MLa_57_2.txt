nowadays, it is argued that watching sports on TV or at live events is an aimless waste of time. this essay agrees that watching sports shows is a useless activity.
first of all, sports shows do not give any new information to a person. peolpe spend hours on these programs instead of doing something useful. they watch how other people play football or basketball, while they are sitting on a sofa. there are lot other activities which are more useful. for Example people can spend this time on studying or doing their housework. moreover, there are a lot of other TV programs with more helpful information. for example programs on scientific channels. when people watch these channels they learn something new and relax at the same time. so, it is more helpful.
secondly, watching sports can be harmful to health. as was mentioned before, people prefer watching sports shows while they are sitting on a sofa. often they eat while watching. and of course they eat some fast food. moreover, they can drink alcohol while watching. so, this is really unhealthy. peolpe can spend this time doing sports. this is as interesting as watching but also it is helpful.
on the other hand, some people do not share my point of view. they consider sport shows to be the best type of entertainment. they think that it is funny to watch these programs. moreover, these shows cause excitement. they root for their favorite team or a sportsman with their friends. sometimes they place bets. this makes watching more interesting. so, it is a kind of pleasure for these people.
to sum up, watching sports is a waste of time because it is useless and harmful but some people find it interesing. as for me, i strongly believe that this type of rest is a waste of time.
