"To watch or not to watch sports?" I think this is a moot point. There are many people who think that it is a waste of time to watch sports events. They usually think that if a person likes a certain sport, then he is better off doing it himself than looking at others. However, I don't know that many people like it.
Moreover, some people really enjoy watching different sporting events. Some of them do this because they are athletes who want to watch their "colleagues" and raise their own level in a particular sport. Some people may like something a lot, but they may not be able to do it due to the circumstances. But this does not prevent them from watching their favorite sports on television. One of the most popular activities in our free time in our country is spending time with friends, rooting for your favorite football team.
As for my opinion on this matter, I think if there were no people who watch these competitions would simply not exist. Competition is a show If there are no spectators, there is no show This may sound rude, but this is my vision of the problem. Sport today is important in our life. Sports and a healthy lifestyle have become a fashionable trend in the modern world, since nowadays people have become more concerned about their health, and sports is the best way to keep the body in good shape and improve health. Sport is by no means a new invention, its history goes back to the depths of time, even before our era in Ancient Greece sports competitions were held in honor of the Gods of Olympus.
