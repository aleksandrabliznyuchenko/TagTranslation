Nowadays some strongly believe that watching sports events both on TV and at the stadium is useless. In my opinion, I consider watching sports people benefit a lot in terms of their personal development and communication with others.
First of all, watching sports one can set goals for themselves. It means that people often see physically fit men and women and take their images as an example to follow. For instance, many boys see Messi and want to look like him, thus they start playing football. In the future, these children can become new stars.
The second point to consider is that watching sports competitions on TV or at the stadiums helps many to build the communications. Sport definitely connects people being fond of it because they have much in common and can easily make up a topic for a discussion. For example, one can go to the stadium and find a new friend discussing the football match they watch.
To conclude, watching sports can be very beneficial for several reasons. First, it helps people to set their life goals and also units the society.
