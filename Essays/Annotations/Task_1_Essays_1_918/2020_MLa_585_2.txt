Many people claim that watching sporting events on TV or going to the matches is a worthless burnout of your free time. As for me, I believe that follow different types of sports is a good thing to do when you have some time for yourself. In this essay the following paragraphs will prove my point of view.
First of all, it is worth considering that watching sport with children can motivate them to start a career in this field. For instance, in Barcelona there is a special school for children who would like to connect their future with football. This school produced the most popular football stars such as Messy. And children take an example from them. It is a really great opportunity for boys and girls not only to get a high rated future occupation but also to lead the healthy lifestyle since childhood.
In addition, watching sports events on TV or in real life helps to unite the families. For example, while the FIFA World Cup 2018 we watched every match and followed the strongest teams until the end of the championship. And we did it by all family and often called over friends with us. Moreover, such international events helps to unite all nationalities from all over the globe. I am concerned that sport is unofficial but international language for all countries.
Taking everything into consideration, watching sports is a really useful way to spend your free time which is also affordable for everyone. As far as I am concerned, sport can teach us to be active, friendly and happy.
