Nowadays people argue that watching sports on TV or in live format is a waste of time. I strongly disagree with such opinion.
Firstly, people were watching sport events from long ago. Even in the Roman Empire, different sports were very importaint part of culture and lots of people were watching them as entertainment. Today with help of new technologies we are able to watch sports without going anywhere and do not waste time on road to any stadium or location, you can buy yourself some snacks on saved money from taxi to event location, which makes it even better way to spend your free time. Secondly, some people can work or study and watch sports at the same time. When there is some kind of a serious and interestiong situation is going on, you will always hear it because of screaming fans. The perfect example of that is my friend Andrew. He just simply turns on TV while studing and only focuse on the most interesting parts of football game, or if he misses something, he can watch a replay.
Thirdly, watching sports is really inspiring. Whatching how good people are at different sports makes you motivated to do the same and become real professional in your hobby and career or if you are an athlet it inspires you to work harder and train yourself to the limit. It always hepls me at gym while doing different trainings.
To summerize, I wold like to say that watching sports is not a waste of time because it is a good way to relax and have fun, it can be mixed with other activities, and finally it inspires you to become better at every aspect of your life.
