Nowadays there are two opinion on such activity as watching sports. Some people believe that it is an useless activity. While others think that it is a great hobby. I fully agree with them. Personally i think that watching sports is a good way to spend time. Firstly, watching sports helps people to be more healthy and easy-going. People often go to bars and watch sports or do it at live sports events. They communicate with each other and have a fun. It also helps to make a new friends. Research says that a communication with different people helps to prevent a depression.
Secondly, it helps to cope with a stess. We are living in very stressfull time. There are many factors: work, ecological problems, financial crisis. Hovever, people can cope with a stress by diferent actions such as screaming or clapping. They can not do this on close friends or partners but they can express these feelings at live sports events or on TV programms.
My opponents may claim that watching football is a waste of time because they can use time to do more usefull things such as reading books. But I do not think so. If sports fans watch sport on TV or at live sports events they probably play sports in real life. Doing sports is the best way to be healthy.
To sum up, i would like to say that watching sport has a lot of benefits such as new friends or good mental health. I do not agree with people who think that watching sport is an useless activity
