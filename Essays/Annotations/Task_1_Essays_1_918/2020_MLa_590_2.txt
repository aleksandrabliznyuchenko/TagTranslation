It is commonly acknowledged that that sport plays an intrinsic role in our modern life. There are countless people who cannot imagine their day without whatching sports and visiting the championships. Meanwhile, some people claime that being spectatour of sport programmes and tournaments is a waste of time. I totally disagree with that statemant and in this essay I will explain my oppinion.
First of all, not every people have enough physical shape for doing sports but they still may be truely impressed by it. For instance, there are many people suffering from obesity or other illnesses. That means that it is almost unreal for such people to do sports themselves but it is real to be a sport lover. Moreover, whatching the sport TV shows and live events with friends can be regarded as one of the most pleasent ways of spending time together. It is true to say that the fact of being a fan of sport team or a particular sportsman unites differnt social groupes together. Nowadays, when we live in the era of high technologies it is not necessery to be a football player to be a part of sport culture. Today people can show thier attitude towards sports while they go to championships or whatch them on TV.
Conversely, the live sport tournaments sometimes can be pretty terrifeing because of numerous agressive fans and crowded aria. Probably, it is better to aviod such events due to the unsafety conditions. Furthermore, while whatching TV sports people do not get any useful information. The sedentary lifestyle can be easily coused by whatching TV and such lifestyle can totally damage one's healthe. So whatching sports can be a real waste of time. By and large, I stick to the point that whatching sports is really nice way of spending time that can also unite different people together.
