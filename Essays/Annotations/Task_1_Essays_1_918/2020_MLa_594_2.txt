Many people likes watching sports on TV, and there are somebody, who think that is just a waste of time. I agree with last part of people.
Firstly, I would like to talk about people who likes watching sport. Many of them are fans of their lovely team or athlete, and they interested of their achievments. Some of them try to bet on sport and win money. Also people like to meet in grooup of friends and watch sport togehter. It is more popular between males. So it is good social process which helps people meeting new friends. And the simple cause of watching sport is that people want to relax and just watch something exictnig on TV. They was tired on the job and dont wnat to do something hard and active. Just stay home or meeting with friends in a sport bar The other part of people who hates watching sport on TV is having their own causes. Firstly, there are many TV programs and shows, which can be more interesting and can make you clever. Also there is a stereotype about unhealthy food and alcohol drinks and watching TV sport. There is no activity and just a harm of your body. Someone thinks that is more better to play sport on a stadion than just watch how other people play or you can go to the fitnes centre to improve your body and helath than just sit in front of TV. You can play sport outside with your family and it can improve your relationship and increase your happines.
i agree with people who hates watching and prefer do real sport, than just watch on it. But iI think, that we must respect all opinions and point of view. Also there is no right answer about watching sport, so you can chooe your own side.
