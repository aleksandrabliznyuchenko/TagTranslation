The topic of watching sports is rather controverial. Some people think that watching sports at home and at the stadium is useless activity and you can spend this time on something better, others disagree. In this essay I am going to provide pros and cons and provied my on opinion on the matter.
In the one hand, being sports fan is a popular hobby. A lot of people worldwide watch sports and common interest can bring people closer. For example, my friend met his future wife at the stadium during baseball game. If they weren't fans of watching sports they would never met each other.
In the other hand, watching sports doesn't benefit in everyday life. Hobbies like playing sports can provide everyday physical activity. Moreover, watching sports can harm your health, as a lot of sports fans are really aggresive. Every year after football championship drunk viewers fight each other on city streets, some of them even die.
In my opinion, watching sports is a great way to spend free time. People can have more useless hobbies, like scrapbooking. Furthermore, sports are important part of our history and culture. My sister won a quiz once because she is a fan of olympics. Her knowledge of the history of sports hepled her to answer question and win the first price. To sum up, watching sports has advantages of bringing people together and disadvantages of being useless in everyday life. I think that sports are important part of our heritage and can be a valuable hobby to spend time to.
