There is an idea that watching sport matches is not an interesting way to spend spare time. As for me, I can call myself a football fan and I think it's a kind of relaxing thing.
First of all, being a fan always lead to a socializing. There are communities according to team who always gather together to see a match. People of this community have the same interests, sometimes this friendship mean some rituals, hymns and symbolics. While being a fan you can find yourself a part of a big family which is ready to cheer you up any time. For example, this not formal community celebrate a good game after seeing a match and discuss the mistakes of a failed one.
Secondly watching sport events means lot of positive emotions. The unexpected decisions of the players make you extremely nervous all the time of the game, but when your favourite team hit a goal fans a ready to laugh and scream with pleasure and delight. Sport events are kind of a show, like a theatre, where the main actors are playing teams. It's always an unforgettable view to see the croud in the full stadion with the flags painted on the their faces and cheering their favourites.
To sum up, I consider watching sport events to be a time that will stay in memory forever and gives lots of pleasure.
