Some people believe that watching any sports programs or visiting a live sports events is just a waste of time. To be honest, I totally disagree with this statement and in this essay I am going to explain my point of view.
Firstly, watching sports or go to the stadium is a good way to stress out. Supporting players during the play lets us feel different emotions, either happiness or sadness it is depend on course of the game and its' result. For example, my father really likes playing football and he has a subscription on a sport channel. So, he has a "tradition" to buys tickets every Friday after stressed week to relax and have fun with his friends, it helps him stay in a good state of mind and express his emotions.
Secondly, I should take into account that watching sports TV programs is really motivating for whose who wants to start some activity, but they are a little bit lazy or "too busy". A good way to illustrate this point is to talk about my friend Ann, she found a millions causes to miss her fitness classes daily. But watching a yoga session with a nice strong moderator on TV in a morning motivated her to take a class exactly that day.
Taking everything into consideration, I would say that watching sports or visiting some sports events is not a waste of time for me, i have a strong believe that it is a good way to have fun with friends or motivate somebody to achieve new goals.
