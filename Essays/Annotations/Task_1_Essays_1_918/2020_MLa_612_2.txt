There are some people who claim that there are no any benefits from watching sports on TV or in a real life, but others do not agree with this statement. As for me, I do not agree with this point of view and I am going to explain my opinion in the essay below.
As far as I am concerned, watching sports is a type of hobby, which is absolutely normal and appropriate. Everybody has different hobbies, which help them to forget about the everyday problems and just relax. So while some people prefer drawing, cooking or reading, others prefer watching sports and there is nothing bad in it. This type of spending free time is a good way to get some exciting emotions and have fun. This is not a waste of time, because it has benefits such as good mood and relaxing. For example, some people do their work at the office and get tired but they feel excited when they come home because they look forward to relax in front of the TV and enjoy football game. This kind of spending free time helps them to finish the day in a good mood.
Moreover, watching sports together with friends or just in a good company is a type of team-building and an excellent opportunity to spend free time with your friends. For instance, people often have no free time for meeting their friends, but if there is an important game translates on the TV, they can make an appointment and go together to the bar or to the stadium to watch this game together. Watching sports together helps them to share their emotions from the game and to feel emotional connection with each other.
To sum up, I want to say that watching sports on TV or at live sports event is not just a wast of time for people who like it because of the benefits of this action.
