This essay will demonstrate the attitude to spending time on watching different kinds of sport. I agree that seeing sport games and matches is wasting my time. Firstly, nowadays there is a tendency that people prefer more to watch sport games on TV or on their mobile phones and gadgets. I think that it is not interesting. This gadgets influence on our health. For example, using this gadgets make people short-sighted. Also people like watching sports championships when thay are at home with some alcohol (usually it is beer) and fast food which cause the obesity, diabetes and heart deases. So, the watching sport is not sporty and healthy at all. It is slowly killing people.
Secondly, I think if people want to watch sports they can take part in playing sport games. It is much more interesting to run, jump and pass the ball to each other than only watching how other men doing these actions. Also playing sport games makes people healthier and gives an opportunity to try yourself in a big sport. In addition, there are a lot cases which demonstrate the effectiveness of sport. As example a minority of unhealthy people have become more powerful and make stronger their immunity.
In conclusion, to sum up, this issue will remain stay debatable. But i stick the opinion that watching sports is a waste of time. Also I would rather prefer to take part in any sport game nor watching it on TV or at sport events.
