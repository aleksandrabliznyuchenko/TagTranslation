There are people in our society, who strongly believe that watching sport is a waste of time. In my opinion, everything depends on people's prefferences, but in this letter i will proof, that those people are not right and watching sports could be very usefull and interesting.
On the one hand, watching sport events can help you the increase you engagement in sport in general. When you watch sport events, you can increase the level of willingness of doing sport by yourself. Due to the sport activities you can make your health better and stronger. Nowadays, there are a huge amount of people, who do not do some sport exercises and not interested in sport at all. So these sportments, whose you can see in sport events, play an enormous role in our lives, because they can motivate us to do something bigger than live a typical life. On the other hand, taking into consideration all arguments against watching sport events, i would like to point out, that sport events are a huge field for advertisers. There are a lot advertisers, who need our view. If there are little amout of people watching sport events, advertisers will lose their money and they will not support sport events next time. That fact can lead to loss of fanancial support.
In conclusion, i whant to say, that there are diffent points of view, and we shoud respect each one, but i believe that watching sport events is not a waste of time.
