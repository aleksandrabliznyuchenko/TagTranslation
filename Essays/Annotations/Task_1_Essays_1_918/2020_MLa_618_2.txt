Nowadays there are many ways to spend your free time, you can go to many places and learn tons of information and even if you mant to stay at home you can use new digital platforms which can help you to spend time. But many people still like to watch sports events like they did many decades. I think that it is important to respect all types of free-time activity but there are many people expecially young ones who arguing with sports watchers and saying that they just waste theit time. Let me say more about my opinion on this topic.
I think that there are no right or wrong sides. Of course watching sports are not so useful as going to theatre or reading poems and books about art for example, but sport can help people to relax and feel happy and i absolutelly sure thet it is the main goal of free-time activity. Also watching sports can help people to unite and find friends, lately it can help them with their work or even with relationships. And we should not forgot that sports events is very important thing in politics. Sports have big cultural and historycal meaning for every nation of the world. Many people earn their money on sport and it helps economics to grow and their are no sports events with this big meaning to country if there is no people who likes to watch it.
In conclusion i want to say that i understand peoples arguments about sports and wasting of time, but this people need just to think more globaly and if they do so, the will understand that sport watchers is doing things that important the same as reading or every other activity.
