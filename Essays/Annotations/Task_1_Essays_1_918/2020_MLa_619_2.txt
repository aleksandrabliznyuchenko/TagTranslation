It is argued that watching sports is a waste of time both on TV and as a live event. I completely disagree with this opinion and in this essay I will state the reasons for my view.
I personally believe that those people who are interested in watching sports spend their time productively. The first reason for holding to my view is that sport unites people. Undoubtadely, watching sports is a perfect way of spending time with friends and relatives. Since sport and watching sports events is a worldwide hobby, people can find like-minded people who are also fond of watching sports. For instance, there are communities in which people are connected by the love of a specific type of sport and they gather together in bars or on the stadiums where they have fun and help their favorite team to win. As a result, watching sports becomes one the ways of communication and finding new acquaintances.
The second reason is that watching sports can be the only way of taking up sports for those people who was injured while doing sports professionally. In that case watching sports on television or attending sports events is the possiIbility to take part in these activities. The reason for that is that this hobby does not require special skills and physical abilities. Moreover, people watching sports events can gain new knowledge of the game, its instructions and even become a professionalist.
In conclusion, although some people are of the opinion that watching sports is a waste of time, I am convinced that it gives lots of perks and benefits. Watching sports is a perfect way of finding new friends, who can share one's interests, and become a professionalist in sports without being involved in the gaming activity for those who can not take up sports for several reasons.
