I have 2 bar charts to describe. The graphs illustrate changes in the use of FB from 2012 to 2013 and the main reasons for usuing FB for men and women.
First of all, the percentage of desktop users decreased in year 2013. It was 150 million desktop users in 2012, and in 2013 there are only about 130 million users. We can see slowly drop. In the several time the percentage of mobile users of FB rapidly increased from about 50 millionsusers to about 100 millions users.
Secondly, the percentage of women who use FB for any reasons is more than the percentage of men. By the way, 54 percent of women are sharing photos and videos and only 39 percent of men. And this cathegory is the popular. Men and women who are receiving updates: the percentage is the same - 39 percent. Women are seeng funny posts more then men - 43 percent Vs 35 percent. And again 35 percent of women are lerning about ways to help others in this years and only 25 percent of men.
To sum up, the percentage of women who use FB for any reasons is more than the percentage of men and mobile use of FB became more popular in the year 2013.
