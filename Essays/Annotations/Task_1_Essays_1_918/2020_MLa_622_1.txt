Two bar charts above illustrate the amount of Facebook users in a one year period, from March 2012 to March 2013. Moreover, the information about the reasons why people use this application is demonstarted in a form of gender proportion.
Overall, it is clear that the numbers of users of Facebook had fallen dramatically throughout the year, especially for the desktop. It is evident from the second bar chart, that the most important reason for men using the current application is sharing photos/videos. As for women, the highest percentage, which is 39%, was shown both in sharing photos/videos and receiving updates.

For women the most insignificat purposes of the app was illustrated in the percentage of learning about ways to help others and seing funny posts, which were 25% and 35% respectively. Second of all, for men is was a diffent situation, because they have a greater percentage in all of the reasons. The smaller percentage was seen in the learning about ways to help others, which is the same case for women, but the percentage is a little bit different.
