Some people argue that watching sports is not the best thing to spend time on. I disagree with this and will state reasons for my opinion in this essay.
There are various reasons for holding my opininon but the main one is that sports are interesting to watch. Sport events can be very joyful and may be a good way to spend leisure time. Watching sports are always bound with a lot emotions which is very exciting. For example, the one tired of work can easily turn on the TV with his favourite sport and recieve strong energy impulse having a lot of fun and forgeting about problems of the life. Everyone is free to choose how they spend their free time. Second reason to consider is that sports can teach and inspire youngsters. Sports are always correlated with healthy lifestyle, a great power of will and overall strenght. By wathing sports teenagers may figure out importance and beauty of healthy lifestyle and benefits of having a strong will. Teenagers often get lost and start to follow destructive ways of living while sports can give them an alternative. It is obvious that interest starts from watching and then grows to actions. This can be applied for adults too.
Lastly, watching sports can unite fiends. Watching sports together may be a nice reason to gather friends at home, at stadium, in bar. Anything that can unite people and attract people cannot be called a waste of time. Even if watching sports is just a formal reasons to see each other.
In concusion, I totally disagree that watching sports is a waste of time. This is because watching sports can be a good way to spend leisure time alone or with company. Moreover, sports can motivate, teach and provide strong inspiration for those who seeks for it. In addition to this, watching sports helps some people stay in touch.
