On the graphics we can see main differences in the use of Facebook from 2012 to 2013 and varities of reasons to use it connected with sex of users.
To speak about differences between the years we can see a little decrease of number of people who use Facebook due to their desktops. In contrance, number of mobile users increased for almost two times in that period so it talks us not only about actively spreading tendence of using everything with mobile phones and gadgets but also about popularity of computers - it did not fall a lot. What is interesting to see, women use Facebook more active than men - almost every reason of using Facebook excite them more.
Also we can analyze the most interesting values on these charts. As it was said, using Facebook with mobiles increased from sixty to a hundred percent in a year. What about desktops, difference is not so huge - only ten percent of voters showed dicrease in answers. To speak about sexes, women use Facebook for sharing photos and videos (fifty four percent) at least for eleven percent more than for another activities. As for men, their usage have no serios differences in percentage values, but the main is a small percent of users who want to learn about help to society - twenty five percent against thirty five of women.
To sum up, I think that all tendences on these charts will continue during the next years.
