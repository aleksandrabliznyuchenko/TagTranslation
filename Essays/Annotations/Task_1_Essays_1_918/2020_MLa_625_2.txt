Nowadays almost every family has a TV at home. It would be excellent to watch it all together, but differences in opinions of family members with a huge variety of TV programmes crease a problem with that. By the way, programs about sport are the most popular in Russia and many of other countries. But does everyone like watching them? Unfortunetaly, no - some people think there is no usage in watching sports.
It is possible to agree with them for the following reasons: firstly, watching any TV program is not healthy way to spend your time. There are many science works written about damage of watching TV so it is not the best way of spending time. Secondly, when we watch sports on TV or at stadiums we may forget that it is neccesary to do sport, not only watch it. It is much clever to exersise yourself than whatch how sportsmen do it.
Nevertheless, fans of all kinds of sports think another way. Firstl of all, it is a plesure to be a part of fans family which includes lots of unknown to each other people connected with one aim - to see how your favourite sportsman or team win the match. Secondly, whatching sports can be a good hobbie because the process of whatching can make you forgot about other thinkings and give a lot of enjoyment and emotions.
To sum up, I can say that I am absolutely disagree with this statement. Sport is one of the most exciting doings not only to do, but also to watch. Fortunately, technologies made all processes for sport fans much easier so now everyone can turn on favourite sport and support lovely team. Is it a waste of time? Of course, it is not.
