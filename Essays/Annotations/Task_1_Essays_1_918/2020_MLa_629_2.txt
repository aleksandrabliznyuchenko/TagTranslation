Nowdays a lot of people like to watch sports. They meet with their friends, buy a lot of junk food and begin to watch it in bar or at home. Also some true fans eatch at stadiums, sometimes even go in other city for it.
Some people say that it is just a waste of time and I agree with them. First of all, this hobby does not make any sense. It is absolutely useless. For instance, when you read some books or watch new film you receive new information that your brain need to process. Secondly, sometimes it develops aggression in people. They hate fans of another teams and there were a lot of causes of public mass fights on stadiums. It is also harms to your health and shows terrible example for new generation. People have an imaginary sensation that they do sport but in reality they just sit and watch.
To sum up, I reckon that watching sport in leisure time is not a good way of spending time. People get only an illusion of participation and sometimes it can make harm. It is a good though to invite your friends on stadium and try a real game rather than sit at home again.
