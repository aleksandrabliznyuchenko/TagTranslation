There are people who are not into the watching sports. They claim that it is a useless way to spend your time. In my personal opinion sport events are enjoying and exciting. The people who likes sports usually watch it on TV, Internet or even visit the live events. I love watching basketball since I was a child, I have my favourite team and always watch their games. Sport events is a profitable business and all the people who is connected to it get their money because the fans are watching sports. Sport is a big part of humans social lifes. Thats why I disagree with those who say that it is a waste of time. However those who dislike watching sports can say that there is nothing useful in watching sports. It is the same way to spend the time as watching TV shows that is a waste of time. You will not be fit by watching sports so that is why there is nothing useful.
As i am concerned, watching your favourite sport event can be a good hobbie. It is a good social event that you can share with your friends and even family. Moreover it can motivate people to do sports too.
In conclision I want to say that these are the reasons why I disagree with a statement. You can enjoy playing some sport games as you enjoy watching it on TV or on a live event.
