It is often thought by many people that watching sports in both real and media variants is a useless time wasting. I fully disagree with this statement.
Firstly, watching sports is an ancient time spending that unifies almost all people around the world. Actually, in early human times sports games were the main point to put people from all country's districts together and find the most powerful and beautiful persons in the country. For example, in ancient Greece every sport competition was very important not only for the competitors, but also for citizens as they could discuss some news from their districts, because there were no communication channels except oral news. Also, nowadays, every Olympic games become the moment when every conflict stops and all the world watch this event. This moment brings peace to humans.
Secondly, watching TV or live sports can rise people's motivation to do things not only in sport sphere, but also in everyday life. It means that when the viewer looks at the whole path that the sport player overcome, he or she will engage himself or herself to try also do something important to get his or her "prize" in the end. For instance, when I was in my primary school, I watched a tennis tournir where famous Russian player Mariya Sharapova won. In that moment I thought that despite all stones on my path I can do all that I want as Mariya did.
In conclusion, I would once again highlight that sports TV programs and live sports events have a great impact on people's character and mood and also account very important hobbies that bring many fans together.
