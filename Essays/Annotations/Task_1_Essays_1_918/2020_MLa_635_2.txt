There is a debate in our modern society about the advantages of watching sports and there is an opinion that this activity is a waste of time. As far as I am concerned, wathing sports show on TV or at live sports events might be beneficial both for athleths (players) and viewers, so I totally disargee with the statement.
First of all, sports shows gives viewers a kind of identity with athlets, sports teams and other fans. It is a well-known fact that fans of sport try to watch every game or competiton and love some athlets like if they were real friends. They experience such a strong emotions while watching the game and feel patriotic when their favourite athlets win and dissapointed (or even angry) when lose. As for the athlets, they also feel viewers support and sometimes it is the main reason not to give up and continue the game.
What is more, watching sports might be even educational, especially for kids. While watching it is easier to memorize all the rules in the game. Professional players could motivate kids to become as fit and healthy in order to archieve sport goals and become popular. Unfortunately, some people cannot do sports themselves becuase of health problems, so watching other people playing is the only possibility for them to take part in sports activities.
To sum up, it is not right to blame watching sports show for being a waste of time as it provide viewers with unforgettable emotions and feeling of identity. Motivation and educational power of wathing sports is often underestimated.
