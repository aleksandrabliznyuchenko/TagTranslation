Some people truely believe that it watching sport on TV or at live is useless and there are no benifits of such a pastime. However, I disagree with this statement. In my opinion sport programms can give some profits to viewers that I will describe in the following pharagraphs.
First of all, whatching sporst is one of the most popular hobbie for many people and broadcasts with their favourite teams or single athlets make them feel happy. Moreover, many of people are sure that they become a part of such sport events if they whatch it on TV or in the Internet. That is also connected with positive emotional conditions. So, if this pastime linked with good mental activity it can not be useless at all.
The secound reason is connected with expensive costs. Some people can not imagine their lives without matches of favourite teams and players. But, unfortunately, sometines the prices are too high and many people can not buy a ticket for sport event. And the only one solution of this problem is the TV programms or live broadcasts. It gives them a chance to see all that happens during the game.
In conclusion, I would like to say that this issue will forever remain debatable. Still I stick to the opinion that whatching sports as a TV programm or as a live broadcast is not useless at all as it is an important part of lives of many people.
