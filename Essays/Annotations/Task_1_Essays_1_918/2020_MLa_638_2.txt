This is not a secret that sport take one of the most important place in people's lifes. It is known from the antique history, that there were always different forms of sport events and now it rest a new form of enjoing activity: not only whatching live but also on TV. Many people belive that it is a silly thing and whatchers just merely lose their time on whatching this. I am partly disagree with this statement and this essay below will discuss some point of thinkining about positive and negative sides of the phenomenon.
On the one hand, I consider that this whatching activity is not less important than cinema ot serials whatching. Sport is one of the way to enjoy human's free time. Someone is more interested in romance films and others in football. Both of this activities can be a wasting of time, but for some people even a playing outside is unnesessary, because this activities do not improve people's mind. These people say that this is childish and do not count as a hobby. Someone can be agree with this in some points, but nonetheless people should respect this choise even if they are disagree.
On the other hand, there is a thinking that sport should not turn to only whatching activity and if person keen on some kind of sport it would be better for him to go and play it himself. It is understandable point, but there are always exceptions. For example, disable people, who can love running, but can not join it because of the illness. One of the method for them to join the community and enjoy the game is whatching it on TV in his or her free time. To sum up, the phenomenon of whatching sport exist and people should respect that. That is not waisting of time, especially if person do it in his or her free time.
