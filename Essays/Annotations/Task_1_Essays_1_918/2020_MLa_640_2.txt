It is argued that people who spend much time on watching sport events are wasting their life and could be doing something useful during their leisure hours.
But this essay disagrees with this statement, as sport is something some people are passionate about and it brings them real joy. First of all, watching sports is a great way to enhance bond and understanding among communities. Secondly, watching sport events can encourage people to follow a healthier lifestyle and stay fit. As has already been mentioned, sports unite people and bring together individuals of different cultural backgrounds, religious beliefs and statuses.
Sports are especially popular among teenagers, who most of the time strive to emulate their sport heroes' lifestyles. Moreover, people who follow sport events are more likely to be involved in healthier activities.
In contrast, some people state, that watching some other TV shows and programmes during free time does not have the same result. It happens due to the fact that the content is not that inspiring, it does not give people a food for thought and has no practical value. That is why the evidence shows that watching sport events help individuals to take off some new activities or to procede with their trainings, which leads to a better life, healthier body and mind.
To conclude, that would be important to mention - watching sports is not a waste of time if it promotes a healthier outlook and a strong community bond among so many different cultures. So, people should encourage each other to develop interest in sport in order to become stronger not only physically, but mentally as well.
