In our day and age many people watching sports. It is widely broadcast of sports events or attending sport tournaments filled with competitive spirit, is about to be an attractive pass time. At the same time some people suppose that it is a waste of time. Personally, iI support the first point of view and will attempt to prove the attractiveness of watching sports events or games in my essay.
To start with, the main benefit of watching sports is that it encourages viewers to try their skills on a particular type of sport. The vast majority of children and teenagers gets so inspired by the players, the excitement of the game, that they start to go to the sports field and play their favorite games. This poses a positive impact on their health, improves their fitness level. In accordance, with recent research, held by World Health Organization, those who get used to doing sport from childhood are less likely to suffer from heart diseases in future.
Moreover, another benefit of watching sport events is that it provides a unique sense of unity with the team and help people to sturt new friendships. Due to that, almost every team in every time of sport has its own fanbase, a group of dedicated people, ready to support their club with no regard to circumstance. Many people started their friendship in such fanbases. For example, my uncle has found his friend in fanbase of CSKA club, he and Michael are best friend for about 20 years. Now they watch every single football game together.
In conclusion, I an strongly opine that watching sports have a number of advantages, such as forcing a viewer to keep in fit, start communication with other fans of sport and came friends, so, sport helps people not to feel alone in the modern world.. Personally, i believe that watching sport wider your horizons.
