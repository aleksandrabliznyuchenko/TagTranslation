Some people may say, that wathing sports is not something serious just wasting time. I am not agree with this statement, to my mind, people are free in choosing what they like and they can get profit in that, espesially in such sphere as sport.
First of all, watching games or sport event could bring unforgetable emotions, which person will remember for a long time. Such emotions can help to solve different psycological problems because it will provide a happiness and calm. Also, in the process if watching sport people's body experiensed a dozen of different fellings, it might be anger, if the favorite team lost the game, or stress, when it is a big competition. Moreover, some of those, who really intreseted in sports probably have some trying to do that or were the sportsmen in the past, so they can understand all the rules.
However, some people say that there is nothing that can be usefull or nessecary in wathcing sport, that it is wasting time without getting any kind of helpful information and things like that. This people don't pay attention to the factor, that being a fan of any kind of spotrs, even if you don't play it, it is a kind of culture. True fans have their own communities, they can organise a meeting and go to watch their favorite team playing in real life or on rhe huge screen.
In conclusion, i think there is a positive impact of sports on mental health, it can charge the emotional condition of humanbeing ang bring the happiness to their lives.
