To begin with, nowadays sport makes people healthy. However, there are people who really like spend their time only watching sport on TV or at live sports events and doing nothing active. However, watching sport programmes people can be motivated to do sports and lead active lives. That is why, I do not agree with this statement.
In my opinion, watching sports cannot be a waste of time because some people doing it can be more interested or start to be interested to do sports and take part in some sport games. So, they are more likely to do it than people who does not watch sports.
First benefit of watching some sports games and events is that people are encouraged in the process, notice some details during games and then try to improve their own sport skills. The majotity of children who watch sports with parents, then want to go to some sports classes or do it with their friends, show their talents and possibilities after watching sport games on TV with sport stars and champions.
Another benefit of watching sports is that it helps to relax after stressfull days. Doing sport and watching it helps to forget about problems, get distracted and immerse in the sport games world. People do not need to make any effort during watching sports after a hard day, they can only watch and enjoy the process. Moreover, the people who are fans and who always should be abreast of some sport events, can save money on purchasing the tickets on the stadiums thanks to watching all sport games on TV.
To conclude, watching sports on TV or at live sports events is not a waste of time because some people doing it are more interested to play it in real life. Maybe one child watching sports with parents on TV and practicing it, then will grow up a sports champion.
