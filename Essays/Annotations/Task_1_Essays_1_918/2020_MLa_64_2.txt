Watching sports is a crucial part of time spending of most people. Some people clame that it is useless and develops lazyness. I can not disagree with this point of view. This essey will examine this point of view.
First of all, watching sports instead of doing them does not make people bodies healthier. For example, it would be much better if people started to play football with each other. It could also improve humans' skills like ability to action fast or play in a team. Creating a playing strategy is also beneficial for mind training. Mental qualities during play are developing too, because people teaches to support and help each other.
Secondly, fans of clubs or even national teams sometimes become very dangerous, because they are really upset about loosing of their favorite team, especially when their team did not won. For instance, they can ruin something or break someone's nose, just to show their great sadness. So, they behave like that without real reasons, but random people can suffer a lot after it.
Furthermore, organisation of sports shows economically not efficient. In other words, sportsmans do not produce any goods. It is not good, because children in Africa suffer from hunger while rich people spend their time and money on entertainment. It is an example of different rights and that people are not still equal and do not want to do anything with it.
To sum up, watching spots either online or at live sports events is a waste of time for several reasons, which are listed above. I totally agree with the statement.
