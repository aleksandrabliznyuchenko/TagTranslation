some people believe that spending free time by watching sports is just killing precious time. However, i disagree with this point of view as in my opinion it is useful activity and has some benefits of its own.
first of all, then people watch sport programs or going to sport events it can learn them several things such as team spirit or cooperation, sport match could be the reason to people to come together and cheer for team they love. fans watching the game together may become closer, can find new friends, can meet people with different status in life, religious or political ideologies, but they all become community. sport events hepl them to forget about difference between them. then team wins an international match, it is celebrating with all the fans, they feel themselves happy.
then children watch sport programs or go to sport events some of them can try to cope players, copy lifestyle, start doing sports and take care of their health, some of children get inspired and choose sport career in the future. for example, i have a friend, is name is Kostya, his father loves football so hard, he took his son on all the matches of his favourite team and now Kostya is on of the best players in his city. moreover, watching tv or going to events with family can help parents to become closer and know more about thair children.
in conclusion it is necessary to say that watching sports in freetime is one of the best ways of spending time, it can help some people to take care of thair health, find hobbies or even turn into a career.
