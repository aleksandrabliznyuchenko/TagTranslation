One of the widely discussed issues nowadays is that some people think that watching sports is a waste of time. However there is no absolute agreement on whether is it a waist of time or not.
In my opinion, it is a useful time, when you watch sports, Firstly, if you are a sport master, you may see useful techniques, that you can use in your life. For example, I have a friend. Her name is Masha, she is 20 years old. She really likes play tennis. One year ago she had a competition, where she wanted to have the first place. The night before, we were watching some tennis competition, where she saw a good serve. She understood that she should use it in her programme. Next day she won because of this trick. Secondly, when you watch sport, the mood is rise. If it is a good game, where you may see two strong team, it is very interesting to watch. You may take some food and enjoy this time with your friends or family, just watch and talk about the game. It may really unite the family. You will have a lot of topics, that may use in communication. Also, if you cannot play sport games, because you have problems with your health, it may help you to feel this emotions. You may imagine that you are this person on TV and you may play this game. What is more, if you visit life sport events, you may find new friends, that will have the same interests with one, You may talk about this event and ask some questions. You may just ask, why he is hear, who is his favourite player and so on. It is really easy to do, when you are sitting near each other.
In conclusion, taking everything mentioned into account i would argue that it is useful to watch sports on TV or real life. You may have a lot of positive emotions, meet new friends or just spend your time with your family and friends.
