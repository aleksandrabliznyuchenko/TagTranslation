Some people do not like watching sports and they are sure that it is a waste of time. I agree with this point of view. People should not watch sports and I am also do not like to do it. Firslty, it is bad for health. People usually sit on the sofa, while watching sports. They do not have physical activities and passive way of living affects badly on our health. If person like sport, it is better for him to do it outside or go to the gym and not watch it. Secondly, people can become addicted of it. Many people are addicted of computer games because games are the reason of very bright emotions. We have the same situations with sports. People always cry when they watch sport. They can become very agressive and they do not think about importants things in their lives because they have only sport in their mindes. Finally, watching sports, people will not become clever. They will spend plenty of time and will not do something special for themselves. They can spend this time for their education, reading, visiting some art gallery or theater. Also they can spend time with their family. I am sure, that this ways of spending time affect much more positively on them, that if they watch sports.
To sum it up, I would like to confirm my opinion. Watching sports affects badly on all spheres of people's lives. It can ruin health, damage self-education snd also relationship with family.
