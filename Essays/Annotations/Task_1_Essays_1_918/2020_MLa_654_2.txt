Sports has solidified its status in human life long leaving the domain of school PE classes and fitness courses. It is a multi-billion business that involves in a way just about everyone with athletes becoming role models and infuencers and events attracting millions of avid followers. With all that, there arises a heated debate if watching such sporting events is time wisely spent. Bellow I will express my view and the reasons for holding it.
I personally whole-heartedly support the claim that watching sports events is a worthwhile activity. First of all, go in for sport myselfand have been doing that for over decade. Sports, it fair to say, occupies a major part of my life ands watching my idol-athletes is another aspect that I enjoy. I have been doing gymnastics since I was 6 and lots of elements that I acquired and perfected were in major part thanks to those Olympics and World championships that I regulary watched.
What is more, when attending live perfomances and differentv games in stadiums we develop a sence of unity and camaraderie. That feeling when your squad is victories and you can parttake in that feeling cannot be compared to anything. It is not surprising that even wars and other conflicts broke off for the duration of Olympics in Acient Greece and in a way it is replicated nowadays.
Finally, sports shown live are great motivational factors for future younger generations.
In conclusion, I believe that sports have more than benefits and watching the events both TV and live can be useful. Not only can younger athletes learns some moves or get inspired, it also unifies nations and brings the whole world closer that we nedd so much especially now in our troubled times.
