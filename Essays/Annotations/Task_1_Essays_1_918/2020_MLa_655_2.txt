In many nations around the world, watching sport events is a long tradition, but some people argue that this time can be used more efficiently. I completely agree with the opinion that watching sports is a complete waste of time. In this essay two reason for my opinion will be discussed.
To begin with, when person is watching something, he is originally sitting: on the benches or the couch. Most of the matches, games, etc. are lasting for hours. If you ever been to a sport event, then you know the feeling when your body is shaped as letter "L": back hurts, legs are tired from sitting. All of this leads to health problems such as obesity, scoliosis and bad eyesight if person watches a game on TV. It is better to do some sports in real life, whether watch it. Moreover, in stadiums, most of the time, junk food are sold, also, at home fans are tend to watch sport events with beer and chips.
Another reason for holding to my view is that such content as football or basketball or any other matches do not evolve our brain, do not make humankind smarter nor develop useful skills. Hours, spent on watching games, could be used differently. For example, person could watch something, that is able to broaden his understanding of life or to help him earn more money. In addition, this time can be used for improving health, improving family relationships. Anyway, watching how other people run or swim or fight can not bring any real benefits for a person, except for hedonistic pleasure.
In conclusion, I definitely sure that time, which is wasted on watching sports can be used proficiently. Despite the fact that in many areas around the world watching sport event play an important role, this activity can lead to harmful consequences such as health problems, brain degradation and simply waste of time.
