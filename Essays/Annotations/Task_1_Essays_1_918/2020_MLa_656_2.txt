There is an opinion that it is totally useless to who watch or visit sport games, tournaments and championships. I completely disagree with this opinion for a number of reasons.
First of all, there is a large group of sport fans who share the love for the same sport and it is their main interest. It creates the community for them and gives a lot of topics to discuss, which is so important during this time of quarantines because it connects people all around the world. Secondly, a lot of sport shows may cause interest in peaople to try out playing this sport themselves, so it makes people healthier.
