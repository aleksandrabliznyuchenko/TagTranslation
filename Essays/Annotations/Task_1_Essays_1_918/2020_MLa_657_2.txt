Some people believe that spending free time by watching sports is killing time that can be spent on more important things. However, I disagree with this statement. In my personal opion, watching sport is a extremely useful activity and has a lot of benefits.
First of all, by watching sports pleople can learn new things about the cooperation and team spirit. Moreover, it is a great way to spend time with the loved ones. For example, cheering together for favourite team brings people closer. Also, professional players can gain immense knowledge about it. All types of sport teams have an enormous level of team spirit that othets who watch can apple to their's daily life. Second of all, the sport lovers, the big fans ususally have role models that insipes them. One tries to copy their actions and adopt their lifestyles. Others get inspired and choose their future career. For instanse, my brother was inpired by famous hockey player Tretyakov by watching all his matches. Moreover, my cousin was inspred by M. Jordan and became a great backetball player. There are many examples of great players who inspire boys ar girls to become the best in the sport.
In conclusion, watching sport can be a great way of spending free time, learning something new for the hobby or be a push for younger generation to become interested in sports and later become the role model for future generations. So people should encourage their children to develop interest in sports by watching it.
