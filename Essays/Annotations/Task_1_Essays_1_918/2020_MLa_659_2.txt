There exists an opinion that spending time on watching sports events whether on a stadium or at home is useless. Personally, I agree with this statement, because people could do other beneficial things in their lives and spend their time more wisely.
First of all, watching sports is a way of entertainment and does not give people any valueable information, but only relaxation and rest. This is why this activity should only be taken up when a person wants to ease his or her mind, but not to educate oneself, because it does not give any food for thought. Take football, for example. It is a game where 22 men run across a field with a ball for 90 minutes. It can be thrilling and exciting, but it gives us only emotions, and nothing more.
Second of all, often sports games are not only non-educational, they also can be cruel. As a result, they encourage aggressive behavior and this type of knowledge is far from useful in our lives. Moreover, people tend to watch sports instead of doing other important things like cleaning, working, reading a book and many others. Therefore, they end up procrastinating and losing their time. For instance, my friend is a big fan of tennis. He would end his work earlier to come home in time for a game, skip deadlines for it and the next day struggling with getting all the left work done.
In conclusion, I totally agree with the statement that watching sports is a fruitless investment of our time, because it does not carry any essential information that can be useful for us, can teach us unwise behavior and take our time for enjoyment instead of finishing important tasks.
