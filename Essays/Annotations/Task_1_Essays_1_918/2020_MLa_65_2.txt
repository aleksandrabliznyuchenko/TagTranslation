There is an amout of people who think that spending time in front of television and watching programms about sport is a useless way to spend your life. I strongly agree with these people because there are much more better ways to entertain yourself.
I think that it is much better to do sports yourself than watch other people compete. If you like to see people fighting, competing or running around with a ball, it is not better than watching kids cartoons like Tom and Jerry. You can spend your time trainung yourself, learning something new, walking in the park with your family or just meditating and freeing your mind. But it is pointless and even destructive to try to find adrenaline in watching other people.
Also, it really is a waste of time because you are not only getting very emotional and uncontrolable when watching your favourite team or sportsman play, but you also strengthening your beliefes in the theory that emotions is something you can not and should not control. It whould be much more useful to go to a sports club and join a football team, for example. When you play with your friends or your teammates, you can also get adrenaline and excitement. But this way you are achieving something. You learn to teamplay, to communicate, to support, you improve yourself. And this way you will experince something that you have never felt before.
To sum up, I really belive that it is much better to spend time getting some important life skills while entertaining yourself, than to let your emotions blow up and destroy everything around while you crying, shouting and jumping for some people on the screen.
