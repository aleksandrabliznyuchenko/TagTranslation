The bar chart under analysis describes the changes in the use of Facebook over a period of one year between 2012 and 2013. As can be seen from the chart sharing photos and videos was the primary reason for using Facebook and the the percentage of people connecting to Facebook via mobile phones instead of computers increased dramatically. It is evident that in comparison with 2012 the use of mobile phones became almost two times higher. In contrast, the scale of desktops use fell from 150 millions to 138 millions. Sharing photos and videos remains the most important reason to use Facebook. Receiving updates remains stable at the level of 39%. Seeing funny posts decreased by 8%. The same situation is with learning ways to help others. The use of Facebook for this reason plunged by 10% from 35% to 25%. To sum up, although mobile phones became more popular, people still use computers to do stuff on Facebook but overall the reason to do it went down.
