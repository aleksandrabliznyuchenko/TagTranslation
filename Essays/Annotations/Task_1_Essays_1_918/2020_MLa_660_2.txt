Many people think that spending their free time by watching sports is killing of the time. However, I totally disagree with this opinion because I think that watching sports is funny and beneficialpastime. To begin with, by watching sports in leisure, a person gets such useful qualities as the ability to cooperate and work in a team especially when a group of friends or family members watch sports together. Moreover, watching sports is very inspiring as people see the success stories of sportsmen and they may follow their examples. What is more, while watching sports games, people can gain profound knowledge about it and broaden their horizons. Later they can show this knowledge in a conversation and demonstrate themselves as interesting and educated people. Thus, watching sports events has a lot of advantages that will help in all the spheres of life. I would like to focus my attention on people who got inspired by famous sportsmen and chose sports as their career. For example, Russian Deputy Prime Minister of culture and sports Olga Golodets said that the successful performance of Russian national football team at the World Cup held in Russian significantly increased the interest of the young generation in football. Boys ask their parents to sign them up for youth leagues of such football clubs as Spartak and Dinamo. So, there are many such stories where a particular sport has inspired people.
Summing up all the above mentioned, watching sports in leisure time is a useful way of spending time and for some people it is not just a hobby but a way of life that may even bring an income. That is why, parents should encourage their children to develop interest in sport by watching it on TV and at the stadiums together.
