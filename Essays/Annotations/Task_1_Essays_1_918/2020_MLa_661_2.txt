It is certainly true that many people spend their time watching sports events. However, others consider that this time is better to spend on something else than sitting behind the screen or on the podium. The sport lovers just need to find a balance between the time that they spend on watching sports events and the time that they spend on other activities. I partly agree with this view and my reasons will be explained in the following paragraphs.
First of all, it is true that watching such events can distract people from many problems. It helps them to do the atmosphere warmer and it can be bring the whole family together. Moreover, when children or adults watch sports copetitions it can encourage them to engage in one of the sports and become a proffesional in it. For example, boxing or skiing. Finally, many people cannot doing sport because of health. So, looking at their favorite team a person despite his illnes still enjoys the success of others and looks at it with pleasure.
On the other hand, sitting at the TV spoils your vision. Moreover, there are still many different hobbies that can be useful for our health.
In conclusion, i agree that people can watch sprts events but not often. As it understood this can lead to some deseases and while you can do something else in your free time. I hope that many people will listen to me.
