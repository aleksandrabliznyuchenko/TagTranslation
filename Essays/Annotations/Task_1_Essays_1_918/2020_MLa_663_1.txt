First of all, we can see that using Facebook on mobile phones has increased from 60 million users to 100 million uses. Comparing to the second diagramm which says that one of the main reasons is sharing photos and videos, I can suggest that between years 2012 and 2013 was developed and improved the photo/video function on the mobile phones which could have caused the increasing of number of Facebook phone users. Moreover, between years 2012 and 2013 the technologies in creating phone apps improved, which also can explain the increase of number of phone users.
Second of all, I can say that women are more interested in sharing photos and videos than men on 15 per cent. Besides, women are more intersted in every suggested reason than men but only not in the recieving updates. They are equal in yhis position.
Consequently, I can suggest, that women spend much more on Facebook just for fun, whem men usually use it for the communication.
