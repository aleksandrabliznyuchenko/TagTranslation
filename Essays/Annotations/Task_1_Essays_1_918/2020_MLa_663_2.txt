Nowadays the problem of wasting our time for nothing is very discissed. Some people believe that watching sports is a waste of time, somehow others claim that watching sports that it is an important activity for our everyday life. I strongly believe that watching sports is an interesting and important activity to colour oue everyday routine. First of all, sports is a hobby which plays an importnat role in our lives and watching it as interesting as playing it. Some people have a hobby or even a tradition to watch sports no matter live or not. Such activites help you find people who is interested in the same sports as you what can lead to start of beaitiful frienship or relationship. Secondly, such traditions is a good reason to spend time with your friends and family. Thirdly, hobbies are important for our life, they help us not to drown in work, university and other everyday rouitine. Moreover, it is a nice way to support your mental health by spending time being happy and diong what you love to do with the ones you love.
However, some people claim that watching sports is a waste of time. Their first argument is that you spend time just watching without doing anything useful. For example, you could do some sports instead of watching it. Their second argument is that people often fight about sports and such arguments can lead to major disagreements between people.
Nevertheless, I completely disagree with that opinion. Firstly, wathcing sports never means that the person who likes watching sports does not do sports himself, it is just another hobby for him. Secondly, the spirit of team union and support is very important for the actual team and this feeling helps unitating people from all over the world.
To sum up, I would like to say that both opinons have been sonsidered, but I strongly hold mine, that watching sports live or not is not a waste of time and has a lot of benefits for our everyday life.
