There is a type of people, that says that when you watching some sports, you wasting your time. In my opinion those people (who saying something like that) are not perfect at their owns. And also i disagreed with their position.
Firstly, we need to remember that all of us got their own method to have a rest. If for someone that is a real basketball game on the street, then we can find the human that will like to watch this game and chilling out. We got no opportunities to tell someone that what they like to do on their free time is time wasting. Everyone can chill like he or she wants.
Secondly, if we take a closer look than we can see that there is competitive nature in watching sports. Fans are cheering their teams and got much of emotions. They laughing, crying and winning with their teams. It can be not very easy to see in firstly look, but support is really meaningful for the both sides. The team that on the court and for the fans. There is many stories when athlets got motivation from the fans and keeped moving forward.
The last argument is about industry. The sport industry can be this huge and massive only because of fans. If noone watched this, then athlets will not earn much money and got time for trainings. It is all the industry. And that if we will not talk about emotional impact of it. So proffesional teams needs their fans, because they are playing not only for their own. But also for the viewers that cheers they.
In conclusion i wanted to say, that noone can say that your interest is time wasting. If you got pleasure and positive vibes when you doing it. So why not. And also if we will take a closer look to that people who says that watching sports is a waste of time then we can see that those people got too much free time. I mean that they dislike their own time spending and because of it being toxic to each other. If we live in society, we must to respect others interests and rights.
