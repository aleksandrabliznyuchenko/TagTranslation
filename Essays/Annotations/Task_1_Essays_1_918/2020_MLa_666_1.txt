The first chart shows differences in the use of Facebook between 2012 and 2013. So, the second one shows why women and men use Facebook. As we can see, Facebbok was used by more than 140 millions of users in march 2012, but the chart shows that this amount of users were using desktops. Also, we have information, that less than 60 million users were use mobile phone to visit website Facebook in march 2012. However, we can see a really different situation in march 2013. Firstly, people started use mobile phones more and it grew grom less than 60 to 100 million users. Secondly, desktops bacame a little bit less popular. The seconde chart shows that 54% of women use Facebook for sharing photos and videos. As we can see, the percentage of men who use Facebook for the same reason is only 39%. Also women use more Facebook for seeing funny posts or learning about ways to help others than men And only for receiving updates men and women use Facebook the same.
To sum up, i would like to say, that mobile phones became more popular for 1 year, and women use Facebook more than men.
