A part of people think that watching sports programmes is useless. Watching sports can help someone to relax, for the other person sports could be a hobby or a work. In my opinion, it is normal that some people have different views and different prefers, but i will try to explain mine. First of all, i would like to say that I am strongly disagree with this opinion. I think sport games are very interesting. Everyone liked to play tennis, football, basketball when he was a child. So, nowadays when we bacame an adults we can not play sport game with our neighbours, but we can watch how are playing people, who are best in sports.
However, there are a lot of stupid useless programs and shows on TV, but i do not think that sports is the same as this programs. Moreover, people can actually make money on sports! For example, on of my friend is very interested in bets, so he can easily raise some money. If you can make money on something, it can not be a waste of time. So, if people say that watching sports is a waste of time, they are just not interested in finding out why a lot of people like it.
To sum up, i want to say that it is very unfair to say that someone's iterests are a waste of time. Everyone can chill how he likes to and you cannot juge him. By the way, i really like watching sports such as tennis and fighting, we usually hanging out with freands and after that go to someone's house to watch sport.
