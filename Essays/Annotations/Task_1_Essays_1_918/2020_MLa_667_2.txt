Nowadays in every house there is at least one TV. Many people prefer spend their free time after their jobs watching a various of TV programmes. One of the most popular TV programm is sports. Many people spend their time wathing this kind of TVs. But some people say that watching sports is a waste of time. I disagree with this statement.
In my opinion all people has their own right to spend their free time the way they want if it is comfortable for them and does not make any harm to any people. There are a number of different hobbies and watching sports either on TV or at life sports events is one of them. Moreover, from my point of view this way of spending time can be very useful for people who watch sports with their friends of members of family. It can be a new topic for communication and many people can find friends in sports fandoms and even start a relationship.
I think that watching sports can be useful even for children. They can watch and enjoy sport competicions and learn something new. Moreover, some children can be inspired by their favourite sports and sportsmen and begin to train. Many of then can become a professional sportsmen and win many awards.
There are also a number of disabled people who can not doing sports, but they always can enjoy sports by watching it via TV or live streams. This people can become fans and find people like them in fandoms.
To sum up, I'd like to say that sport is the part of the national culture and people should be interested in any kinds of sport. It is helpful for many people to find new friends.
