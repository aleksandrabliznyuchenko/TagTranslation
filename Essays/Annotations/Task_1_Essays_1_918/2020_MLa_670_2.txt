Nowadays it is argued that watching sport is useless way to spend time. From my point of view, the truth is that admiring sports events or sitting in front of TV is definitely not the best hobby.
First of all, it is clear that big sport events are very dangerous. In psychological articles it is written that the atmosphere on live sport events produces aggressive attitude because of the emotions (like extremely energy and over supportive behavior) and actions among people. Accordingly, the stadium for football or hockey matches is one of the most overcrowded places, where people do not care about safety and respect for each other, that is why visiting sport events can lead to traumas, moral stress and even death. For instance, during the worldwide famous FIFA 2018, in every country were the death statistics of football fans.
Second of all, watching sport programs may lead to a lot of tough problems with health. Generally speaking, watching sport at home is often accompanied by a bad habits such as junk food, snacks and beer. This has an enormous affect on organism, increasing chance to have an obesity or diabetes. There are consequences for moral stability too: the scientific works conclude that the majority of fans is often suffer from loneliness and sports lovers are emotionally unstable. Unfortunately, many people spend hours or even days in front of TV channels, while this time they could spend with their friends, partners or family. For instance, in one of the scientific works was a terrifying statistics that almost a quarter of married couples in Russia got divorced because of the enormous addiction of a partner to sport games translations.
To summarize, the popularity of sport events and programs has bad consequences too. I personally agree with the opinion that it it is only wasting of time.
