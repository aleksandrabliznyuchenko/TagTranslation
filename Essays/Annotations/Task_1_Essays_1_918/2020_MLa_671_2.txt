It is agued by some people that watching sports is a good way to spend free time, while others strongly believe that it is not good idea and just a waste of time. I am not agree with this opinion and in this essay I will try to state the reasons for my view.
The most compelling reason for my view is that waching sports can help people to broaden theit horizons. First of all, people can know more about different sports competitions, sport teams and famous players. For example, when children watch football match with their fathers, they ask parents a lot of questions to undestand the rules of the game. Morereover, such knowledge can help in school lessons.
Another reason for my position is that watching sport on TV can motivate people to do sports in real life. For instance, people see strong athletes on TV and want to have the same fit. In adition, after such motivation some people really go to buy fitness center subscription and try to follow healthy lifestyle. In this reason sometimes it is good idea to watch sports on TV.
Lastly, watching sports is a good way to get bright emotions. For example, when people support their favorite team, they really worry about all the players. If the team is win, you also feel happy and have good mood.
In conclusion, I would like to say that I absolutely disagree with the statement. Watching sports on TV or at live sports competitions can really give you a lot of bright emotions, motivation to follow healthy lifestyle and interesting and useful knowledge.
