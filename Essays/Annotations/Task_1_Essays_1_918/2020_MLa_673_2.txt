In our days sports events take big part of lives for some of us. Some people prefere watch them on TV some one prefere live sport events but some people think that this is simple waist of time. Now we will try to understand every position and we will try get the correct point.
On the one hand watching sport events can be a really good hobie for thous who are interestied in sport or for thous who practiced sport in earlier life. You can be pationd in some tipe of sport and you can really know more then others and to catch some benifits from your knolidg. Watching sport events is also a good reason to geather together with friends in a big company and spend a good time. Live sport events is a much more fun. When you are at the stadium you feel the energy of thous who watch event whit you. The atmosthere when your team wins could not be retranslated in words.
On the other hand such type of intertaiment as watching sport events could not be naimed as needless. The time that people spend on watching sport events could be waist in more productive ways. You can lear somethig new or do that you would never do again. Some people even do not understand that they live once and in some day their time of life would over.
In conclusion I would want to say that for my personal opinion watching sport events is a real waist of time if you do not are interest in it. I mean that I do not see any reasons to watch sport events if you have something more interesting to do/
