According to some people, spending free time by watching a particular sport is just killing precious time. However, i disagree with the statements as in my opinion it is a useful activity and has many benefits of its own.
To begin with, by watching sports in free time, one can learn several things such as cooperation and team spirit. Sports teams exhibit a high level of team spirit that one can apply in one's daily life. Also, while watching the game, we can gain knowledge about it. Moreover, watching sports with our loved ones is a great opportunity to spend some quality time with them. Better still, cheering together for our favourite time brings us closer. Hence, watching sports offers many benefits that are much needed in every sphere of life. On the other side, despite of strong reasons mentioned above, there are few drawbacks as well, many big companies promote and sponsor these events to market their products. This generates lot of revenue for the country and must be promoted. And finally, one of the most important reason for watching sports is you can learn by watching and play these games.
To conclude, i don't agree with watching sports is a completely waste of time. It may be a waste if you watch too much of it on TV. But again, being a passive fan on the ground or in front of the TV is not as bad is being portrayed commonly.
