Nowadays there is a controvercial opinion that watching storts online or in real life does not worth people's time and there are a lot of other activities that can be done instead. I totally disagree with this statement and believe that watching sports can be useful. In this essay I will provide my opinion regarding this issue and support it with arguments.
The first thing to consider is that watching sports can positively influence one's mental health and bring positive emotions. People who regularly take part in sport events as spectators can express all their emotions during the play and get rid of any negative feelings which are not a rare thing in the modern world. Moreover, different beneficial hormones are produced in our body. For example, football fans can scream, act loudly and actively express their emotions during the match. This way, they decrease the level of stress and get positive emotions.
Secondly, watching sports by other people is extremely important for sportsmen and sport teams as they need fans' support to stay cheerful and motivated. By watching sports on TV or attending sport events people show their hope and support. It makes the sportsmen know that they are responsible for the result and they try harder to win. For instance, during the Olimpic Games fans all over the world support their teams through the TV screen or in real life and this cheerful and supportive atmosphere can really help the sportsmen to overcome difficulties and win.
In conclusion, there are controvercial opinions abot watching sports, but I strongly believe that this activity is not a waste of time. Firstly, it has positive impact on our mental health as it decreases the level of stress and brings positive emotions. Secondly, watching sports is a great support for the sportsmen which can help them to win.
