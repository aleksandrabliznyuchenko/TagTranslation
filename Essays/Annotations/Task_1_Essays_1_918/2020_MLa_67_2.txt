In today's world many people are keen on different kinds of sport and follow each event, where participate their favourite team. But others considering this passion as a loosing of the time. Personally, I completely disagree with the second group of people, who claim the uselessness of attending sports for some reasons.
First of all, I would like to stress that watching sports make a connection between all the people from different parts of a city or country. It is true, that on live sports events people, who keen on the same team, can become best friends and go together anywhere to celebrate the win or to drink for the loose and discuss all together the most treaky and interesting moments.
Secondly, nowadays people have an opportunity to make money by watching sports. Special organizations work in the principle of rates on sport events. Men or women from the age of 18 years old can come to such companies, create their account in the system with the help of assistant and after all make rates on different sport events. If the considering was right, then he or she will get a sum of money, which will be higher then the first sum. So if the person is the expert in analysing of different sport teams and can forecast the result, this person can be really rich in future because of watching sports.
To sum up, it is an private choice of anybody: whether to follow sports or not. But, in my opinion, such way of spending time can be very useful and interesting.
