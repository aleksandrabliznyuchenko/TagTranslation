Searching for a way to realx, people choose various ways to spend their leisure time - and watching sports is one of them. However, some people believe that such hobby is neither useful nor entertaining. I disagree with that point of view. In this essay i will describe my point of view.
First of all, watching sports is a very emotional activity. While rooting for their favourite team, people feel tremendous excitement - and for a while they can forget about their work or even personal problems - and these are the main purposes of any hobby; they have to bring joy. For example, some people come home from work in a bad mood, but instead of arguing with their loved ones they may use their energy to cheer for some team Secondly, most of the people prefer watching sports in some company. They either go to the sports bar with friends or to stadiums with their families. As a result, fans of some sports hane an opportunity to befriend many new people. For example, it is a well-known fact that football fan-community is very vast, and there is a huge number of people supporting this on that team. It is always easier to breake the ice when one knows that their interlocutor shares some of their interest; and rooting for the same sports team may bond people quickly.
In conclusion, watching sports (both on TV and in the real life) is rather fun and cannot be called useless as it brings people the things that they crave for, that is positive emotions, new people and their friens support.
