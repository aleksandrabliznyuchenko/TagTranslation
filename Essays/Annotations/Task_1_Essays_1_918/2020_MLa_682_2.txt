It is sometimes said that people waste their time watching sports.
I personally believe that watching sports is no waste of time as it helps people to relax, forget about their problems and have some fun.
First of all, watching sports is a good way of spending time after a hard day. People who had a rough day at work come home exhausted and having no energy to do anything active. They can turn on a sports channel on TV and spend some time thinking about the game. This way they can have some rest and ease their mind. For example, when I come home late I sometimes want to watch sports to forget about all the deadlines I have. Watching sports also makes you feel as a part of a huge fan community, so it is also a great way to find some new friends with same interests.
Second of all, watching sports can be a great activity for a group of friends. It this case watching a game is a reason for friends to meet and spend some time together. They can also share a meal while the game is on. It is also a good cause to talk about their lives and discuss anything they want. For example, a group of friends can come to a sports bar and spend an evening there together.
To summarise, I would like to say that even though some people believe that watching sports is a waste of time, I still believe that it is one of activities which a person can do alone or together with friends. From my point of view, watching sports also has a lot of benefits.
