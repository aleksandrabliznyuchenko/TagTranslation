It is said by some people that watching sports is a waste of time and it does not metter whether it is on TV or at live events. Is it really like that? As for me, sports is worth doing in any form and it is not neccessary to run or play football on a pitch if you take any advantage of it and have great emotions.
For the first reason to make my opinion clear, i can claim that watching sports is for everybody, while doing it can be demanding. Actually, to do sports, you are ought to spend money and a huge part of your life on trainings (especially, if we are talking about professional sports). Many people do not have such options, as they are focused on daily routine, job shifts and even children. Furthermore, people can have health restrictions, which make them not to do sports at all, even if it is for beeing in a good shape. For instance, we can remember about disabled people, who would definitely like to play some game, but can not do it. Thus, watching sports will be a brilliant experiance to have.
The second reason for my point of view is that watching sports sometimes gives you a great opportunity to have fun and unforgettable emotions and memories. When you are plaing sport games, you are always switched off from the real life and doing your best for winning. But if you could see your actions from the other side, you woud be ammused how interesting and thrilling it is for other people to watch you. A good example hear - a hockey. In case you are lucky to watch the game, you will have your hair flying because of unnormal speed of the play, when ice is melting under competitors. As a result, your skin will be covered up with goose bumps and adrenaline will have control over you.
To summerise, all the given reasons (such as understanding that you can take part in procces infront of TV and have amazing emotions no metter what) make us believe that watching sports is not a waste of time and undoubdetly worth it.
