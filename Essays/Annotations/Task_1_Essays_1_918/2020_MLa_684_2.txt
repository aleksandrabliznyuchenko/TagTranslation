There is an opinion that watching sports is a waste of time. To my mind, if a person is not a professional sportsman, watching sports is a waste of time. There are a lot of sportsmen, who should watch sports in order to their sport better. For example, footballers should watch other games and observe details in order to know the advantages and disadvantages of a command which will play against them. Also some sports techniques could be watched on TV, for example swimming techniques. Trainers have to watch sports in order to teach sportsmen. When people watch sports, they can learn the rules of different games. Furthermore, sport is a good theme for speaking to men, so some people can watch it in order to communicate with other people, who are interested in sports. As for the live sports events, the emotions that visitors get from these events are exiting.
I am convinced that watching sports is a waste of time for people who are not a professional sportsman. If you are not a sportsman or a trainer, you do not get any useful information from watching sports. While sportsmen can practice what they see, other people could only watch. If this watching does not give any useful information for people who are not sportsman, they just do it for fun and it is a waste of time. To sum up, sportsman and trainers watch sports in order to know something new, while other people watch sports for fun. Watching sports for fun is more likely to be a waste of time.
