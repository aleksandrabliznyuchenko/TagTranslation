Nowadays, the 'human race' is widespread and popular. There are plenty of activities to do every day even every hour. So, there are people who believes that watching sports is not the preferable way to spend our time on. Moreover, they say that it is absolutely silly idea.
As for me, I do not agree with the statement given because I guess that watching sports live is the best way to have a rest and make the breath of fresh air during the break in 'human race'. Statistically, if a fan visits matches (or watches it on TV) of his favorite team, it means he is more happy than a person who does not support any team or game.
The position I am writing about may provocate some argues about. For example, they may say that it is not necessary to watch the game and to be the part of sports competition as a fan is stupid and wastes lots of time a person could spent on his daily purposes.
However, usually they make sport events after working hours or even at weekend. The time that everyone may spent on watching his favourite sport with participation of the team he supports with his family. That moments usually gives to people an unbelievable amount of energy that human needs to be in good health.
To sum up, I would say that I do not support the position made in the statement and I wish everyone to feel the happy moment of watching sport with his family.
