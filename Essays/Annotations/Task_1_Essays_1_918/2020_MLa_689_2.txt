It is the common knowledge that people in 21st century do not have a lot of free time. So, we have to decide how to spend our free time: watching sports or do something helpful for your life. I agree with convincing that watching sports on TV or at live sports events is a waste of time. On the one hand, sport is a part of our life and it is a type of communication too. People want to know what is going on in professional sport life and then discuss the most interesting things with friends. Sport TV shows or live sport event is a thing that you can discuss with your friend. For example, my dad with his friends always com together to watch football matches in sport bars. Or another good example, my best friend and her family have a tradition to watch biatlon together. For these people, watching sports is a way of communication and spending time. Moreover, watching sports makes you very emotional. It could be good emotions when your team win, or sad emotions. Otherwise, getting emotions is good for people.
On the other hand, in my stand point of view, watching sports is a waste of time. I am convinced that we do not have a lot of free time, so, when i have a free evening, i would prefer to do sport myself or reading a book. It is more better to learn something new, than watching sports.
In conclusion, although the positive sides of watching sports, I am convincing that it is a waste of time.
