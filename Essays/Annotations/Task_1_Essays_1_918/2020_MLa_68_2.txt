Nowadays, some people think that enjoy watching sports and consider it to be beneficial to many people. However, others suggest that watching sports is extremely pointless. In my perspective, both these opinions can be taking into consideration.
First of all, there are many reasons why people love both playing and watching sports. Sport makes people be active, fit and provides good energy. Being involve with game at live sports event is facinating. It is makes a lot of people with common interests together, people can find friends. Also, sports events are full with good music, tasty snacks that some can find vary appialing. The same with watching sports on TV, it brings joy for those who are fans of perticular sport or team. Its time to relax and having a great time. On the other hand, when you watch sport events on TV or live you are not doing much. There so many useful things you can do instead watching sports. Some people say it can be addictive to some unstable minds. Besides, laying or sitting while watching can harm your phisic due to the length of the sport event. It can cause some severe problems with your spine. All things considered: although some people think watching sport events is waste of time. I believe it can bring you more advantages in terms of socializing and having good time.
