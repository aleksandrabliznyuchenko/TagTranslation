These days, many people argue about whether watching sports programs is really a waste of time. There are many points of view some people think that this is really a full activity. Others say that it is very interesting. I belive that such sports viewing is not necessery. We will talk about it now.
In fact, people spend a lot of time watching live sports. First, they lose time that thay could spent on self-development. Secondly, looking this, theay are like under hypnosis and can not soberly assess the situation around them. This is due to the fact that they are very involved in the process. For example, if a person watches a spots programm at home, he may not notice someone enterning the apartment or even enterning the room, or thay may not notice a cup breaking. So, the point of waste of time is half clear.
However, true sports fans would not agree. They belive that watching sports is a small part of live. Therefore, they give themselves to the process entirely, imagine themselves next to their life without watching such programs or playing games live. Moreover, some people even think that such kind of activity will help them in their bodybuilding. It is strange, but there is an opinion that uf you actively, supported the team during the viewing, you also did some sports. Thus, some people think that it is really a good use if time. Actually, i think that watching sports is a some kind of waste of time belive that people should spend less time on this type of activity, because you can do many other things during this time. If you are disconnected from reality for 2 hours, you not only do not notice your surroundings, but also lose 120 minutes hf useful time. In conclusion. i want to say that there are indeed different opinions, but i belive that people should devote more time to their real life, since wacthig sports will not affect your life in any way, much less make you smarter or healtier
