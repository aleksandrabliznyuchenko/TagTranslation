It is believed by many that the time spent spectating physical competitions // sports (whether it is live action or TV programme) is a time spent without any sense. I partially agree with this statement, though there are some reasons for controversy in this question.
On the one hand, sports watching creates a ton of different communities for people cheering for the same team or sportsmen ranging from social network esports team fan club to a street gang of Westham United supporters. Moreover, these communities are helping people to socialise and to make friend. Hence, they create a more healthy social environment which is benefitial for society in general. Indeed, in my university group there are a company that is connected through love for Russian football team Zenit.
On the other hand, there is a problem with sports industry in general that, in my opinion, overweights all the pros. The point is that spectating sports fakes action: one starts to believe that since they are interested in sports, they are close to sports. Meanwhile the reality can be significantly different, because to be really into sport one should love doing this sport as it provides them with great health benefits, while still helping to communicate with other sport lovers. Moreover, i know that from my own experience, as i like trampoline jumping and i met the vast majority of my friends in sport centres.
In conclusion, I'd say that sports viewing is probalbly a waste of time, since one can have same benefits doing sport, not watching it. Furthermore, doing sports provides way more pros from the health point of view.
