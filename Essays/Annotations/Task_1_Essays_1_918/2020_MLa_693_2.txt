Some people claim that watching sports on TV is a waste of time. They believe is ts do not give "food" for our emotional intellect and brains. Also, people might that we have a lot of advantages to spend our time and watching TV is not interesting and good way. For example, everyone can choose more exciting doing: to go for a walk with friends, family, pet, girlfriend or boyfriend, read books, do homework, go to museum/theatre/cinema and other fantastic places.
First if all, I agree with this statement, because many people waste a lot of time on online-life: smartphones, TV programmes. In my opinion, our life is very beautiful and exciting, and we have a lot of advantages for self-realisation. Despite of this, some people do not take all by life. Nowadays we can do sports online, in fitness centers, in open air.
Secondly, I guess that TV has bad influence for our health: for brain, eyes. Moreover, speaking about our health, I want to point mental health too.
In conclusion, I want to say that watching sports on TV is a waste of time and everyone can choose better way for free time.
