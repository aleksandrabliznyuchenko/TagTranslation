Some people say that watching spots is a waste of time. Is it so?
In todays world full of constanct disagreement, the way we watching sports has dubious discussion. Some people saying that watching sports is not a good idea, but the others don't agree with them.
Personally, I'm sure that there is nothing bad. For someone this is a job which brings money, someone gives free time after work or study for relax. I don't agree that this is a waste of time, because of everybodies prefers. People devote time to what they have a heart for. It's the main feature of people's social behavior. For example, as a child, I dreamed of becoming a swimmer, but parents strongly recommended to become a doctor. I like watching sports while I have enough time for it. It brings me pleasure. People decide what to do with their leisure time for themselves.
However there are people who are in sharp disagreement with my opinion. They consider that watching sports is waste of time. Maybe they are making free time for job even outside the hours of working day. They used to always work on themselves.
A lot of people say that they have neither time or no opportunity to doing sports at home or outside in a gym. What is more, they feel tired in the end of a day/week. That's why people have to prefere watching sports on TV or visit sports events.
To conclude, sport is always good, no matter what format you use to doing that. It's always important to be interested in events, people who are masters of sports. It gives a wide background for your devolopment, shows versatility.
