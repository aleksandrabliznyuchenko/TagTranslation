Some people believe that it is useless to watch sports on TV or at live sports events. Others, by contrast, claim that watching sports is a good idea for spending time. I completely disagree with the first opinion and in this essay I will try to prove my point of view.
First positive side of watching sport is that people who love sports but do not have opportunity to do it themselves, can watch it and save the time. What it means is that there are a lot of people who keen on sports. However some of these people have quite busy pace of life and so do not have free time to go somewhere and do sports seriously. Watching sports on TV or at live sports events is the best option for such people because they should not waste their time for trainings, sports trip and other initial things for serious sports. For instance, my father keen on football but does not have time for doing it seriously. That is why he chooses watching football on TV.
Another positive side of watching sports is that this process is very useful for professional sportsmen. In other words, it is a good opportunity to watch how your competitors play because it allow sportsmen to better understand competitors' mistakes and their strategy. So, sportsmen will be able to change something in their strategy and improve their play. By way of example, there is a common practice when many football teams watch not only competitors' matchs but also their own and discuss it in details with the trainer.
To sum up, I disagree with people who think that you waste time while watching sports. Firstly, watching sports on TV or at live sports event gives busy people an opportunity not to waste a lot of time ant watch sports at the same time. Secondly, it is an important and useful process that allows to do your best for sportsmen in the real game.
