The non-stop growth of TV and Internet usage has provided humanity with a vast amount of fun services. Such activities as watching sports programmes on TV or going to live sports events are considered as a waste of time by some people nowadays. From my perspective, it is true that you could use your time more rationally.
Firstly, watching other people do sports on TV or live doesn't give you as a man any real profit. People don't become fitter or more educated by only watching other people workout. Although it can be a thrilling experience to watch a sport game and share the same emotions with other fans around the world for some people, these activities don't teach anyhing good or usable. In my opinion, such activities should be considered as a fun-activities only, and therefore should be watched less. Of course, no work and no play makes you a "dull boy", but if you want to grow over yourself you should do profitable activities more often.
Secondly, instead of watching sports people could do sports themselves. I rarely watch sports on TV and never go to live sport events. I find it much more interesting and breathtaking to participate in sports activities by yourself. These activities teach you to think strategically, to work in a team and to go to the end. This can help you in a real life, and you'll be prepared when life really hits you. And if you really like your kind of sports and train hard to achieve great results, who knows, whether you will be the one who is watched by millons of eyes?
In conclusion, I'd like to say that sports programmes and live shows should not disappear completely, but I am fully convinced that watching sports nowadays is a complete waste of time.
