Sport events and videos about them are very popular nowadays. There is an opinion, that visiting sport competitions or watching them on TV is not a good way to spend your time. I disagree with the statement as in my opinion it can be useful and gives you pleasure.
First of all, when you watch sports you can learn about rules and the whole process of the game. This could help you in future, if you decided to take part in it someday. Besides, you can not only get knowledge about the sport, but also understood such things as cooperation and even use it in your daily life or at work. Furthermore, if you have friends who likes the same kind of activity, it is a good way to spend time together by watching games on TV or on the stadium.. For example, when you watch a football match and cheer for the same team, you can feel such thing as team spirit and become closer to your friends.
It is important to remember about sport stars and champions. They could become a great role model as for kids, as for adults. Many of them are successful in their sphere and they can inspire people not only for taking part in some kind of sports, but also make a career. For instance, there are many small kids that decided to try themselves in sport after they realized that you can become successful, if you try hard and never give up.
To sum up, watching sports can be very useful and it can give you many benefits in your life. In my opinion, it is a great hobby and a way to spend your time, especially with your mates and beloved ones.
