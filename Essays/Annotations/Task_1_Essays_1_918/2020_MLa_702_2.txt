According to some humans, spending the leisure time by watching different types of sport programmes is just a waste of time. However, I would say that I disagree with this statement because as for me it is a beneficial and useful activity.
Firstly, when we are watching a play or a game we gain new information about it or about a certain type of sport in general. Also, by watching sports a person lifts its own team spirit and cooperation feeling. And this might be useful in daily life while one is communicating to someone. Moreover, if a person watches sports with its loved ones they have an another excellent opportunity to be brought up together and spend good time cheering their favorite team (or not). Otherwise, they simply liberate themselves from negativeness when supporting different teams and confrontating each other during the game.
In addition, sport fans have their role models who motivates them daily. They all want to be fit like them, follow the same diet like them and finally adopting the same healthy lifestyle as they do. Also, there are so many stories when people, even from infancy, got inspired by the famous players and also became ones. A great exaplme of this phenomenon is a succesfull career of 21 year-old Kylian Mbappe who was inspired by Christiano Ronaldo. Once a teenager, he was spending hours watching videos of Ronaldo on the internet. Nowadays, they are both ones of the most highly-paid football players in the world.
In conclusion, watching sports programmes in free time is a useful way of spending it and for some people this interest can even turn into a future job. So, parents should raise awareness of their children into sports and encourage them to watch it and participate in it whenever possible.
