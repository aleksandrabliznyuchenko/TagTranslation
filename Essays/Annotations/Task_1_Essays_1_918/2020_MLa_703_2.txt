Nowadays a lot of people belive that others waste their time while watching sport events on television or at live. I disagree with this statement and in the essay I will explain why.
First of all, people can be interested in some kinds of sport, but he can not do this sport because of health problems or person does not have enough time to do it. For example, people can work in the ofice the whole day, they do not have enough time and energy to do sports on the period from Monday to Friday. Also these people want to relax on the weekends, so they decide to watch some sports events on TV at home to feel like they are actually involved in this sport activity. People can take part in some sport game as a viewer.
Secondly, watching sporst on TV or at live sports events is a great opportunity to spend some time with friends and family. For instance, many people work on a different jobs, so they can not spend time with their friends or family on the business days. Watching sports at live sports events or on television is a good reason to meet each other and to communicate. At this time people can be with close friends and family, can share some stories and solve problems together, while watching a sport. which everybody from this group of people life. Taking everything into consideration, i would like to say that some people say that watching sports on TV or at live sports events is a waste of time. However I strongly disagree with this statement because person can watch sport events on television or at live because he can not have enough time to do sports he like by himselfe. Finally, watching sport on TV or at live is an awesome opportunity to meet griends or family and spend some time together.
