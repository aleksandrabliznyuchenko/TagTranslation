There are a common oppinion that watching various sport programmes or attend sport events is useless thing. However, I cannot agree with this point of view as I am convinsed that sport is an essential part of human's lives that unite people and give positive emotions. So, not only doing but even watching sports is advanterous.
Why watching sports has plenty benefits? First of all, when people attend sport events or watch them on TV, they feel as a part of their favourite team. As a result, they gain a lot of emotions whether their team wins or loose. Furthermore, such phenomena leads to the unite of people who has similar preferences considering teams or players. A great example of this case can be footbal fans whoes community is famouse all over the world. So, it is obvious that one more reason to watching sports is an opportunity to meet new people with the same interests and even to make friends with them in a future. In addition, watching sports is an easiest way to relax and have a rest watching people who have to make increadible phisical efforts to become a winner.
Nevertheless, some people suppose that watching sports is a waste of time. The main their reason is that watching does not mean doing any phisical affort, so it is like an immitation of phisical activity. As a result, when people watching sports or attend such kind of events they think that they do something useful but it is an illusion.
To sum up, I suppose that watching sports is as important as doing them, because this activity provides plenty of social apportunities. Also, it is a great source of positive emotions and energy.
