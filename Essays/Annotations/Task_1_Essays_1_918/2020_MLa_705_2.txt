There are so many kind of sports nowadays and every person has the opportunity to watch them on TV, on the Internet or at live sports events. Some people state, that people who watch sports just waste their time, but I think that this kind of activity may be good for a person.
Firstly, all people need to rest. This mean that watching sports may be the way of recreation for a person. When people watching sports they forget about their troubles and just concentrate on the game or competition. Secondly, watching spotrs, especially at live sports events, is a perfect way to meet new people. This mean that a person can get known with people with similliar interests. Sport fans always keep in touch with each other and often meet to watch their favourite game or competition together. It is always great to have friends who share your hobby.
However, there are people who think that watching sports is not the best hobby a person can choose. They claim that this activity will not give new knowleges and will not improve any skills. I think the hobby a person has chosen not always should bring something useful. Person may do it just for fun. The spare time should bring satisfaction for people.
To conclude, I would like to say that the activity which bring a person pleasure and recreation hardly can be called "a waste of time".
