There are different opinions about watching sports: someone thinks that it is very interesting but others consider that watching sports is unuseful type of spending time. Who is right? Let's see.
To my mind, there is so little hours in a day and you have only 24 hours for a lot of differnt plans: learning, work, sleeping, eating and cooking, cleaning, spending time with your family and doing something for changing your life to the best. As for me, there is no time for watching TV and for wasting your time. It is not interesting to watch at how somebody is playing, thus more interesting when you are playing with your friends or family.
Also you are not thinking when you watch any sports, you just want someone to win but your brain is relaxing during this time. Nobody can not change when he or she is doing something unuseful for his or her development. We must always want to be better and for this we need to read, to think, to watch documentary films or any interviews and many other but not to watch someone's sport games.
In conclusion I need to say that there are more important doings, than watching TV or live sports events, thus for ordinary day watching sport games is just a waste of time and we should do during the day much more useful deals.
