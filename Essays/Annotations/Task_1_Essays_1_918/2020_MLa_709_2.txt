It is argued that watching TV or live sports events is not worth wasting time. Some people find this amusement benefitial and those who apposed to positive opinion claim that is not. I am not inerested in sports activities but, from my point of view, watching sports events may be a good option to spend one's time and in this essay I am going to explain why.
First of all, people who watch either TV or live sports events can be motivated to follow healthy lifestyle. It is not rare that one is encouraged by the sportsmen from professional sports industry, makes someone his of her ideal and want to transform yourself for being as much as possible like this ideal. Thereby, they start to do sports and even eat benefitial food for strong fit. For example, the popular footballist Messi fans always tell that they love what he does and they strive to achieve the same succes eating healthy meal and doing excersices.
Another positive aspect in watching sports events is favourable leisure time. Everyone need spare time to spend it with pleasure, namely hobbie. It makes us more relaxed and we are getting calm and happy. Observing sports events is one these hobbies that can bring the peace to people's minds. Morover, there is the research from Garward University that proves the mood of sports lovers was getting higher during watching football and visiting live competitions made them even more happy.
In conclusion, I restate that TV and live sports are not time-wasting amusements or just a time-killer as it could be encouraging to do sports and just a wonderful hobbie that makes people happier.
