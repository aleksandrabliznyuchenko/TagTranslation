Some people believe that spending free time by watching a particular sport is just killing valuable time. However, I disagree with the statement as strongly reckon that such kind of activity is useful and has many benefits of its own.
To begin with, it should be mentioned that watching sports in leisure time can contribute to developing such values as cooperation and team spirit. Sports teams are good example of a community based on core collective values everyone could inspire to apply in everyday life. Besides that, watching sports with our favorite gamers or teams is the way to exchange with energy, giving them our emotional support and getting in return pleasure from their game. A good example is a hockey or soccer world competition which are full of emotions and adrenaline. Hence, watching sports offers many benefits that are much needed in every sphere of life. Additionally: sport could be treated as the way of living or iconic model to repeat. It is generaly spread the situation when sports lovers try to apply role models of beloved sportsmen. For instance, one tries to copy a footballer and follow his secrets to stay fit and ultimately gets benefited by adopting healthy lifestyles while another get inspired and choose sports as their career. As a result, this behavior develops us as mature personalities, proving us with great life opportunities and chances. Thus, such life stories are very useful examples as they not only inspire an individual but also contribute to this life success.
To conclude, watching sports in leisure time is a good way of spending time as for some people this hobby could turn into a career. Consequently, i believe that parents should encourage their children to develop interest in sport by watching and participating in it.
