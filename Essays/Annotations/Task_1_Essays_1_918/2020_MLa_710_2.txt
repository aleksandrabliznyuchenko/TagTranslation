Nowdays, it is a popular belief that watching different sports competitions in various ways (such as on TV or on the cort) is a reason why we waste our time. I partly agree with this statement. In this essay I am going to express my point of view.
On the one hand, firstly, watching sports is a kind of enjoining our free time such as visiting concerts, theaters or cinemas. When we want to relax we do not try to be tired and our mind wants to be empty. Watching the TV or going somewhere helps us to be more happy. For example, when we watch out favourite match or a game with our lovely team, all our mind is concentrates on the game and this action helps our brain to relax from the rutine and problems. Secondly, sports competitions is a way to receive an adrinaline. During the game we express our energy and bad emotions to the competitors and our relatives are not suffering from our bad mood. For instance, person, who has some problems with his work, can watch the match and express his gloomy mood on the competition, he receives the adrinaline and after the game he will be more calm with his relatives.
On the other hand, watching sports is an unhealthy alternative to going to the gym. People are not going in for sport when they are watching it. They can spend their time in the gym and become healthier then they are. To illustrate this idea I can say that person can waist their time when they are sitting behind the TV and watching it while they can go somewhere and do something more useful for his health.
In conclusion, I can say that there are different ideas about watching sports. In some ways it is a good alternative to spend free time or a perfect way to express your bad emotions, but also it is an unhealthy alternative to do sport exercises so it can be a wasting time.
