On the one hand, someone think that watching sports is a bad idea to spend time. On the other hand, watch sport games is a good thing to do in yor free time. I disagree witn this topic, I think that it is a brilliat way to spend time. For example, it is good idea to call all your friends together in one place to watch some sport event. It can be a footbal match, tennis or any another sport. In our life we forget sometimes our friends, because we have a lot of things to do, we have problems that we have to solve and after all we don't have time to call someone and ask about ealth and life. So, we can meet everybody in one place, drink something together. health There is a good life story. I have two friends for long time, we live in different places in Moscow and it take a lot of time to meet with each other, so sometimes we meet in a bar or at home to watch some sport events on TV. We like football, so we watch football, sometimes we can watch UFC or something like this.
Some football palyers can watch football mathes with stars of football to take some good fints or moving from them and try to do it on traning. Coach will see it and probably will help him become more better, than he is now.
When you are come on live sports event it is something brilliant, a lot of fans shouting some teams words, all wear coreful things with club symbols, there are a lot of events near the stadium where you can win something. You can go there with your family, it will be nice time together.
At the end, I want to say, that sport events for a long time were things that connect people from different countries, different cities. They can meet together in one place, may be it wiil help somebody in future. Every contry want to take Olympic games, because people from all over the world wiil come to this country and watch sport event.
