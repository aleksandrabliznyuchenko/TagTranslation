Some people believe that it is wasting time to watch programms about sport on TV or live perfomanses. As for me I am disagree with the statement. In this essay I would like to see why watching sports is not a waste of time. In this paradragraph there will be agreements for those people who think that there is advantages for watching sport shows. From my point of view there are some positive moments for people who want to know more about sport and for those who can not travel in countries where different sport events are coming. For example, small guy is interested in basketball and he do not know about rules and fisical needs for join the team. For him it would be usefull to watch some programs where he can find all answers for his questions. Although, live streams of sport events can make someones dream come true, because he or she can watch it sitting at home of there is no way to visit country where it is lokated.
This paragraph is about another reason for my point of view. Watching sports is one of the method to relax like others. Some people who work or study hard and felling stressful can find watching sports very relaxing because they can give their agressive or other emotions to comment the show instead arguing with frends and family. It is the way to calm down and then do different home tasks or going back to work and studying, or spending time with family and friends.
In conclusion, we can see that wathing sport programs is not a waste of time. It can be useful and relaxing.
