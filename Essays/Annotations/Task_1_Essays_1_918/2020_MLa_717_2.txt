Nowadays the society argues about watching sports. Some people believe that spending your time behind TV or attend live sports events is a waste of time but another are against of this idea. This essay will provide my opinion that claims that I totally disagree with the statement.
The most compelling reason for holding my position is that these types of spending leasure time may encourage young people. If they were watching their siblings, parents and elder generation are interested in sports, it could encouraged them to dedicate their life to sport. As for result, in long term period the nation of young, ambitious, hardworking people could grew up. And their desire to stay health and fit will be transported to their children as well.
Secondly, watching game live gives a big energy boost. Visiting such event gives you an opportunity to see all famous players at one place. That is why this day could become the best day of sombody's life. Giving the positive emotions is the one of the main benefits of attending sport competition at the stadium.
Lastly, watching sport games on TV is a good idea to spend family time. Feeling unity between parents and their children will give them a chance to become closer and understand thoughts and willings of each other. For instance, there was argues between father and son. During watching football their conversation can go peaceful way and they can tackle their problem, become close as good friends To conclude, taking into consideration everything mentioned above the question is still to be discussed. However, I support the idea that there are a lot of benefits watching sports on TV or live and it is not a waste of time.
