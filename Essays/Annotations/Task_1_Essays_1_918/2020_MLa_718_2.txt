People have different opinions about going in for sports and especially watching it at the stadiums or at home. Many person prefer this way of spending free time but there is a part of people that do not want to believe that it is an awesome opportunity.
I totally disagree that watching sports on TV or at home is a waste of time because millions of people are engaged in different sports, for instance, sportmen, trainers, people that have sporty hobbies such as dancing, football, tennis and skating, where they can find new friends with common interests. They like to see the process and different techniques that are not available to them. Also, it is the best motivation to improve their skills and to become more professional. The second argument is about international competitions and difficulties with transfer. Moreover, Not so many people have a golden opportunity to travel around the world and see their lovely competitions with great footballers, for example. In this case, they are able to stay home or go to the sport bar and see the game.
However, there is another opinion about such a hobby as watching sports and some people think that this hobby have only lazy people that do not want to do anything, they are only viewers. Additionally, there is a stereothyp that only unemployed men love to watch sports at home. I want to add that sport fans often prefer to watch games with alcohol and after that their behavior is not correct.
To sum up, I would like to highlight that there are different opinions about watching sports but I think that it is a golden opportunity for many people to feel themselves happy watching the games and there favourite sportmen.
