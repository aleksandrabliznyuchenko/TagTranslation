Watching sports is extremely popular with people of all ages, many people find it a good way to spend their time. However, there is an opinion that people only waste their time while watching different sport events. In this essay I shall examine the merits of both sides of the argument and state my own opinion.
There are some strong arguments for people to say that watching sport is not a useful way to spend time. For example, some people try to earn money this way - they bet and then win or loss money, that depends on the success of the team or a sportman. In that case people really waste their time and often - money either. Additionally, watching sports can be a waste of time when a person does it too often and without a particular reason - not to support a team, for example, but just to watch a game of teams he or she does not even know. This means that a person could spend this time in a more useful way.
On the other hand, there are many reasons not to consider that watching sport is a waste of time and I think these reasons are much more persuasive. Firstly, sport is often a hobby for people and it is normal when they spend some free time watching their favourite sportmen performing or following a sport game. So this can be just a good way to relax after work and enjoy. Secondly, many people do not only just watch sport, but they really support their favourite teams or sportmen. Support is extremely important in sport and all the people that follow sport events are a part of a big sport family. Moreover, when people watch sports they do themselves, they can improve their skills while watching the technique of professionals.
To sum up, both points of view can be supported by strong arguments and having considered both sides of the issue I can not say that watching sports is a waste of time. It can be a good hobby for people, a good way to upgrade their skills and at the same time it can be a real support for sportmen.
