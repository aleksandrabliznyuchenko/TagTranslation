Nowadays people have lots of various resources to get closer to sport activities, even if they do not take part in it by themselves. There is a belief, that watching tv translations or going to the stadiums is irrational. I partly agree with this point of view and this essay will show both sides.
On the one hand, using tv screens for watching sports or visiting such events physically undoubtedly requires some time, which you can spend on other activities. For example, to meet with the family, work more hours or read a book. Additionally, a person can take part in some outdoor games, such as football or volleyball. It will be much better for health and it also helps to develop stamina and some body muscles. Moreover, it can consume some money, because web or tv translations and especially tickets for big sports events cost a lot.
On the other hand, it can become a hobby for a person to support a team or a sportsman and bring lots of pleasure. What is more, not all people can afford to do some sports, because of some illnesses or other restrictions. As a result, the only way they can be connected with sport is to watch on TV, Internet of from the seat on the stadium. In addition, there is a unique atmosphere of challenge and support on sports events, especially at some football matches. People unit and scream together, it can be also a kind of an emotional therapy.
To sum up, each person should decide if it excites him or not. Despite all benefits and drawbacks, it can be a waste of money and time for some people and be a great source of positivity and energy for others.
