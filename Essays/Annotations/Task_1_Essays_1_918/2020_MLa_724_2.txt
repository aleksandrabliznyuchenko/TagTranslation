There is an opinion that it is not reasonable to spend your spare time watching different tipes of sport on TV or to go to fitness occasions. Personally, I disagree with the statement. In this assay I would like to explain disagreement.
From the early ages sport was one of the most fascinating amusement for people. Sport rallies people, different nations. On competition sportsmens communicate with each other, share their culture. For example, every four years sport representatives meet on the Olimpic Games. They show the world opportrunities if their country. Also, all the nation becomes more united by rooting for their country. We can remember the Olimpic Games in Sochi. On this celebration all the nations become friends in Russia.
In contrast, there is an opinion that people waste time while watching sports. Of course, not everyone likes the same things. But in every person there is a spirit of exitement. Sport consists of this spirit, thirst to win and competition. To cheer for the team is very interesting because you never know how life will turn out. It is like a game, where you place a bid on someone and wait for a win.
To sum up, I would like to say, that it is up to everyone. If the person enjoys to spend his or her spare time on spots, they can do it. If she or he does not like such tipe of activity, it is normal. But it is important not to express the criticism of those who enjoy sports.
