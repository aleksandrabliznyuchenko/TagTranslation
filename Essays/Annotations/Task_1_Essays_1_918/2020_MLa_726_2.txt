Nowadays, it is hard to imagine our world without sport events and sport in general. A huge number of people from different countries follows and support sport teams by various ways. Some people consider that watching such events like sport competitions is meaningless and it is better to spend this time for something more productive. Nevertheless, the others think differenlty and I agree with this opinion.
First of all, I believe that watching sport events will motivate people become more active and healthy. For insatnce, it is easy to explain by some psychological theories - when people watch the behaviour of somebody they love to (in our case sport fans love and support their sport team of player), they subconsciously want to imitate this behaviour and to be such sporty too. Furthemore, such sport competitions will help fans not only to relax but also to restore emotional background and free their minds. While watching sport, people who are really worried about players express all negative and others emotions: they shout a lot, cry and laugh during the competition - all these emotional outbursts mainly have a beneficial effect on the human psyche, promote emotional release.
On the other hand, some people suppose that insted watching sport it is more useful to do any other things in leisure time such as reading, studying or even make money for yourself or family. By permanent watching such sporting events people will spend all their free time to the detriment of personal life (parents or family) and even worse mindlessly spend money on bids. If people can not control such behaviour, he/she will become obsessed with sport competition and not inetersted in anything else, become isolated.
To conclude, I stronlgy believe watching sporting events during one's free time is not just a waste of time. Such entertainment provide us many beneficial things and in moderation help society to improve every day.
