In this essay, I will took a both opinion to try to draw some conclusion One hand, people can seat for hours watching the tournament for football or soccer. Many people today spending time watching TV instead of indulging in sports and using some entertaiment facilities that their city provide. Moreover, when people watch TV or sit a sport event, they mostly take some snacks with them in order to please themselves. In today's society, a healthy lifestyle in the huge conserm that people forget that they bye themselves.
On the other hand, watching sports can also be beneficial for people. First of all, people can improve their knowledge and skills about sport when they watching it on TV. Watching sport is an exellent form of entertaiment today. Watching sports can not only entertaint people, but also teach them about sport rules, for instance.
