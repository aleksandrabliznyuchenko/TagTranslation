Nowadays some people believe that watching sports programms on TV while they laying on a sofa is a waste of time. Others don't agree with them. Where is the right?
In our digital world we often prefer watching serials or TV rather than go to a gym or go for a walk with a dog. That is why some people think that it wasting their time. In my opinion, it depends on each cases. Mostly, I disagree with a statement because there are people who have favourite sports team or player and they like looking for him at live sport events. Also, people don't always have opportunities for playing football for example or cross running in case of their treatments. It's not mean that they must stop allowed beeing in a sport sphere by themselves. Also many parents are might be invited to watch sports games (like Olympic games) theirs children.
In the other hand, there are lots of stereotypes of sports lovers, especially, football lovers. They can be dangerous and too agressive for other people on a stadion. I mean, it is not normal and wasting time for them. Moreover, to be a viewer' from the side is a bit boring them beeing in a centre of a game.
In conclusion, I would like to say that watching sports is a normal practice for some people. But I agree that it is not interesting as much as be a sportsman by yourself. It would be better to do your homework instead of watching TV itself.
