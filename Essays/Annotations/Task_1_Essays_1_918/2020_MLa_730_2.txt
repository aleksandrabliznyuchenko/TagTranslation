Nowadays, it is considered by some people that watching sports on TV or at live sport events is a not beneficial spending of your time. While there are others who think that it is a good way to spend your free time. This essay will discuss both views and provide my own opinion.
On the one hand, many think that time that you spend on watching sports can be use for another useful things. In other words, you should find another ways to spend your free time. Firstly, you can go for a training and do the sports by yourself, not watching others doing sports, you will become more fit and healthy. While when you are sitting at home or in the bar with your friends watching TV or live sport events, you do not have this ability. Secondly, you can spend more time with your family, read more books and do a lot of other things.
On the other hand, spending your free time by watching sports (either on TV or at live sports events) is not a waste of time due to the fact that it has a lot of advantages. For example, it is a good way to spend time with your friends, because you can discuss the game, the match of your favourite team can serve an occasion for your meeting with friends.
Finally, in my opinion I strongly disagree with the given statement that WATCHING SPORTS (EITHER ON TV OR AT LIVE SPORTS EVENTS) IS A WASTE OF TIME. FIRSTLY, DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE I THOUGHT ABOUT JOY AND EXCITEMENT YOU FEEL WHILE WATCHING THE GAME. IT IS UNBELIEVABLE! IT IS REALLY A GOOD WAY TO SPEND YOUR TIME IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A TOP-QUALITY REST. SECONDLY, FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT IS TRUE THAT WATCHING SPORTS CAN DEVELOP YOUR ATTENTIVENESS AND IMAGINATION. THESE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES. IN CONCLUSION, THERE ARE A LOT OF OPINIONS ON THIS CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT WATCHING SPORTS IS A WASTE OF TIME. BUT I STRONGLY DISAGREE. THIS WAY TO SPEND YOUR FREE TIME HAS A LOT OF ADVANTAGES.
