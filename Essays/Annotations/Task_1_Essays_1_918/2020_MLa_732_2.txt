Nowadays people believes that watching all kinds of sport, no matter on TV set or at live sports events, is the waste of their time. As for me, I agree with this statement and I think that this topic has prons and cons.
On the other hand, some people agree that spending time and watching sports on TV or at live sports events is a waste of their time. And they have some reasons for it. For example, if you watch sports events at home you just sit and do nothing except watching but you can spend this time to work or do some phisical exercises. Also in a moment of watching TV you can eat some junge food and it can harm you health. Moreover, if you go to the stadium or some sport centre to watch sports events, you shoudl pay money for tickets. And sometimes this tickets can be very exspensive. On the other hand, some people disagree that if you spend your time on watching some sports events at home near the TV set or at live, it is a waste of your time. They think that spending their time in this way they can support their favourite team and also get pleasuar from spending time and wathing sports events. For instance, that fact that a lot of people go to the stadium can hepl team or sportmen believe in thier power and it can change the way of game. Also people at live sports events can feel themselves not alone. Supporting one team leds people to unite and believe in the same.
In conclusion, I would like to underline that I support the idea of watching sports events on TV or at live and I disagree that this kind of spending time is a waste of time. On the my way of thinkung, this way of spending time relate people from all side of planet and also it study people how to work in team.
