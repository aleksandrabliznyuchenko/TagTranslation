It is argued by some that spectating sports events is a waste of your time. I completely disagree with this opinion and in this essay I will state the reasons for my view.
The most compelling reason for holding to my view is that for many people those event are not just games but their hobbies. This is because they feel pleasure while watching something they are fond of or, at least, understand. For example, there are always shouting different chants on a stadium or wear the same clothes and colours with the other spectators of their favourite team. As a result, sport is an enjoyable tradition of uniting family and friends together and share the same emotions.
Another reason for my position is that sport games motivate people to keep feet. Parents watch sports and habituate their sons and daughters to be interested in it too. That is why many children perceive sportsmen as their role models. They admire them and want to copy. So, most of the time children ask their parent to join some sport clubs.
Lastly, sport events unite people together and make them feel like a part of a big family. When people cheer for the same team, they pursue the same goal. They share their emotions and feelings together at the same time and the same place. As a result, they are all celebrating victories and are upsetting about the looses.
In conclusion, I totally disagree with the opinion that spectating sport is just a waste of time. This in not true, because sports events bring people pleasant emotions as it can be someones hobbie or a tradition, watching sports also motivates young generation to take up a new activity and it unite people from al over the world together. Given this situation, it is recommended to visit sports event more often and just enjoy the time.
