There is an opinion that watching sports on TV or attending live sports events is a complete waste of time. I can not fully agree with this statement, because, as far as i am concered, watching sports can make some positive impact.
On the otherhand, watching sports is quite useless. One gets no exercise from watching - on the contrary, you strain your eyes, you worry a lot for some people you do not even know and you are probably taking time from other more useful activities, such as spending time with your family or doing actual sports. Also, if you go to a bar to watch the game with your friends, you will probably consume some unhealthy food and drinks. In addition, now one can consider going to live sporting event not even a waste of time, but also dangerous for their own and public health, as we are living during a pandemic.
On the other hand, watching sports brings the feelling of unity. You can watch sports events with your family and cheer for the same team. You can even get inspired by sports and start playing it together. Moreover, live sports events fill you with joy and give you the sense of belonging, as there is nothing like being among hundreds of like-minded people. Futhermore, there are far worse time-wasters in the world., i.e. Tik Tok and Instagram. Compared to those, watching sports is quite useful - you have to remember the rules of the game you are watching, all the key players and their history and it requires a lot of brain activity while watching Tik Tok can only inflict a headache.
All in all, one might consider watching sports events a waste of time, though i am convinced it makes more of a positive impact despite all the obvious drawbacks.
