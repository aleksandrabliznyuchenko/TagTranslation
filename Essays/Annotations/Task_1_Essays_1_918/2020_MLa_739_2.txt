Nowadays a lot of people become fans of different types of sport. it depends on specific of century when we live. There are a lot of TV or online sport channels, live sport events where you can by cheap ticket. But the are people who still thinking that wahtching sport is waste of time. I disagree with that opinion and in this essay i will explain why.
First of all, watching sport games is a kind of a hobby. As we can not say that drawing, cycling etc. is not a good hobby, but wasting of time, we can not say the same about watching sports. All hobbies are good if they make you happy. By the way, not only for people who have never played any sport, but for people who are professionals already it is a great spending of time. For instance, my father's friend was a hockey player in the university, now he is 50 years old and he is not playing hockey anymore, but often goes to live matches of his favourite team, it's his favourite hobby.
Secondly, for some people watching sports is the same as communicating with people. It gives energy, relax, and have positive influence on them. Many decades ago scientists said that human is social organism, we need to feel that we are part of something really special. A lot of people say that something extraordinary happens when you are screaming special words to help your team to win. In one of YouTube videos of popular BBC channel man with hard depression had tradition to go to every football game of his favourite team. Matches took place in far region, but man wasted his energy to get there anyway. After every game he feels very good, forget about his depression and all sypthoms of this illness go away, this are the reasons why he do not think that watching football is not wasting of time. In conclusion, each of us should decide for ourselves if watching sport games is wasting of time or not. But let us think that it is the same hobby as other and it helps people to feel good.
