Sport has always been the important part of humans' culture. Millions of people every year visit sport stadiums in order to watch different matches and support favorite team. Moreover, with the development technologies humans get ability to watch sports on TV at home. Although watching sports is extremely popular, there is an opinion that watching sports is useless waste of time. In my opinion, this is not true and in this essay I will try to justify my point of view.
Firstly, watching sports is perfect recreational entertainment. While watching sports people can have a rest from everyday home duties or job. Although watching sports at live may consumpt some energy, it is still can benefit people. They feel themselves satisfied and happy. In addition to it, in case of the win of preferable team the fan receive enormous amount of positive emotions.
Secondly, watching sports enable relations and social interactions between humans. While watching sports people tend to join in groups and talk a lot to each other and having fun. Also they can create fan group which includes thousands of fans. Such type of social activity is beneficial to the whole society because people become more united and social.
Nevertheless, some people are sure that watching sports is a waste of time because people during the watching sports actually doing nothing by themselves except following the process of the game only visually. But in my point of view this is not absolutely correct. Watching sport can seriously motivate a lot of people go in for various sports which is good for their fitness shape and health.
In conclusion I would like to say that sports is unseparatable part of humans' culture and society which can be profitable for people of all over the world in many ways thus making the humans more sociable and healthier.
