Nowadays there are lots of people, who think, that there is no point in watching others playing sports. Nevertheless others are disagree. Let us discuss the tastes and preferences of both sides.
As for me, I strongly believe that sport programmes do not provide us with anything really important. To begin with, they are made for coaches potatoes. Instead of taking care of our health and keeping fit we watch other enjoying it. Moreover with our sedentary pace of life sport programmes just another way of encouraging passive enjoyment. Lust but not least, we substitute extremely useful activities for meaningless pursuits. Doing sports is a great way to stay energised and organised. Watching sports is a great way to stay lazy and depressed. For instance, I personally believe that doing sports was the most important activity that helped me to overcome my sorrow.
However, stay-at-home or shout-at-the stadium fans claim that watching sports do no harm. It helps us to run away from everyday routine. What is more, it allows us to let our steam escape. My elder brother says that a sport match a day keeps the phychoanalyst away. He prefers to anger at "that stupid team leader" not at "that annoying coach" at the gym nearby.
My opponents lose sight of the fact that the "harmless hobby" makes them addicted to secondhand experience.
To sum up, I would like to say that we should not confuse doing real sports and watching a happier one doing it. Sport activities make us become better in so many ways and that is the last thing to ignore
