Nowadays some people say that watching sport for example on TV, internt or on live games is useless. However some people disagree with this opinion and think that there is some point in doing this.
On the one hand sport is important part of our social life. Some people can find friends on intrests. For example, you can like the same kind of sport: football, valleyball or even golf. It is doesnt important what do you like someone probably like it too. Moreover watching sport can not only help to find new friends, but also can also make you closer with your friends and family. For example, if you are a big. fan of fotball and your girlfriend can not stand it you can invite her to the live game on stadium. Probably she will feel the atmothfere andl enjoy the match. Now there are a lot of communinty that were organized by fans of diffrent commands. Sometimes even whole familis are the fans of one command. It makes them feel even closer toe each ther.
On the another time watching sport can really be the waste of time. Firstly when you are watching sport you are not actually participate in it, so you are probably just sittnig on a coach or in a bar and it is not good for your health as doing sport. Also time that you spend on watchng sport could be spent on more important things, for examlle work or education. It is much more ipmortant to make more money on the work to feed your family than having fun watching sport.
There are two points of veiw on this statemet. That watching sporst is importatn and there is a point in doing it, And that is a wasete of time. Pesonally i disagree that watching sport is useless. For me the most importanat thing in our live is our happinese and if watchng sport help to cope some problems and make people fell better it can not be waste of time.
