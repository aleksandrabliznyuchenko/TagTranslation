Many people in the world enjoy to watch sport games and sport programs. However, some people think that watching sport is just a waste of time. In this essay I am going to look through different point of view and share my own opinion.
On one hand, watching sport may stop obesity. Nowadays, society face with obesity problems because we get to work by taxi, eat unhealthy food and do not have time to do sport. Watching at sportsmen (on TV or at the sport event) may motivate people to do exercises and take care of their body. For instance, there are a lot of articles illustrating the positive influence of sport programs on human motivation.
On the other hand, watching sport programs does not mean doing sport. When we watch programs we seat at home (or at the stadium) and use our free-time to watch about sport but not to do it. For example, according to the British scientists every fourth watch sport events (on TV or at live one) and only every eights doing sport exercises.
In my opinion, watching sport is not just a waste of time. I believe that human tend to compere hisself/herself with other. Sportsman is a good example to compare body. If people will compare theirselves more often - thy will start to think what they do for their body and what they eat. It will help society to solve the obesity problem.
All things considered. Watching TV sport programs and live sport event motivate people to do sport, however, to watch sport does not mean to do. To my mind watching sport is not just a waste of time.
