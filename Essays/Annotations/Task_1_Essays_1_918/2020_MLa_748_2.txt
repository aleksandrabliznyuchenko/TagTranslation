Watching sport games is a vital part of many people's lives. This hobby makes us closer to each other and to our country. However, some people claim that this is a waste of time and money. I disagree with this opinion. In my view, sports enhance bonding within communities and promote a healthier lifestyle.
Such opportunity as watching sport is for those who are truly fans of the sport team and with this they come to cheer for it. Fans watching the game together may have different status in life and may endorse different religious beliefs. However, when they watch the game, they have only one concern in the world and that is to see their team emerge victorious. Obviously, sport events bring people closer and help them forget their differences. When their tim wins an international match, it is celebration time for all of them. Sports events ignite patriotic feeling in people.
Community bonding is not the only benefit of watching sports. When people watch their favourite team in action, they feel encouraged to stay fit and live healthier life. Needless to say that people who watch sports matches regularly tend to live physically active lives. For example, a recent study showed that there was 30% increase in gym memberships during the recently held World Cup Football championship.
To conclude, watching sports is not a waste of time. It promotes stronger bonding within communities and leaves a positive impacts on people by encouraging them to pursue a healthy lifestyle.
