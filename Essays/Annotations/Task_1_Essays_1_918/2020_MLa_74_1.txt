I am looking at the chart which display quantity of desktop and mobile Facebook users in March of 2012 and 2013. Besides, there is the chart which shows why people use Facebook.
The vertical chart demonstrates a huge decrease in the number of desktop Facebook users from 150 millions almost to 50 millions. In comparison, the number of mobile Facebook users reduces not so drastically approximately from 140 to 100 millions of users. The gorizontal chart shows the fact that the most popular reason of using Facebook among men and women is sharing photos and videos.
All in all, charts demonstrates that the use of Facebook is decreasing and there are a few reasons of Facebook using.
