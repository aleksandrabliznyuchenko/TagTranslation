There is an opinion that watching sport competitions, games and so on in front of your TV or at the stadium, for instance, is spending your time for nothing. I can say that I absolutely disagree with this statement and I am going to explain my point of view.
I consider that nothing gives you that wide spectrum of emotions that watching sports does. When you see that your favourite team is losing you feel player's stress and sometimes desperation, but if it wins, you share team's joy and happiness. The feelings are sharper when you watch the game live, because you experience stronger emotional connection with the team you love and other fans who came to watch it. People seek for emotions and watching sports is a great way to get them.
Getting together with your friends and going to live sports events is the best option that you choose if you have spare time. Such events make you closer to your friends and you learn about each other new things. Besides, this activity can become the most memorable moment of your life when you young and reckless shouting slogans and enjoying yourself, your friends and the community of fans.
To sum it up, I think watching sports at home or live is great atcivity that you will certainly enjoy.
