There is an opinion in a society that watching sport on TV or a computer is pointless action. But i think that it may have some benefits. The following essay will discuss why i do not agree with the society opinion.
To begin with, some people say that TV sport programs is uselles and it is watched only by lazy "sportmens". I do not really agree with this statement. First of all, watching TV sport programmes could something like meditation - it is very helpfull if you had a realy bad day. You just can switch on the TV on sport chanel and wath how sportsmens are trying to win the price while you sitting in a comfortable sofa and eating somethig tasty. But, saying seriosly, TV sport programmes can bring real benefit. For example, for children: it is a great way for youngsters to find the sport that they will like. Children may see different kinds of sport, it rules, chellanges and risks, and after analysing everything, they can choose the king of sport that they are really life. Furthemore, those who do not like TV sport programmes could not watch it. It depends only on viewers taste -: if you do not like it - do not watch it".
To sum up everything that was said, you can see benefits of sport programmes if you like it. Also it could be very helpfull for youngsters and those, who do not know what sport to shoose. fffff f ff f f fffff ffffffff fff fffff fffff fffffff fffffff ff ff ffff fff fffff f fff ff fff ff ff ff fff ff ff ff ff ff ffffffffff f fff ff f f f
