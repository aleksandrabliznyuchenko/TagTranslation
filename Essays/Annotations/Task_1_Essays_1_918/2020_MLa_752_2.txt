Nowadays a lot of people believe that watching sport events either in real life or on TV/ online is not worth doing. I strongly disagree with this point of view and there are some reasons for my position.
First of all, watching sports can be a kind of people's hobby, which can help people to khow themselves better, to understand somebody's preferences and motivate to do sports regularly. For example, a boy who likes watching sport activities on TV will be a great fottball player in the nearest future.
The second reason of my point of view is that watching sport programmes or live plays can be a type of spending people's free time. It is better to go to various sport events than to sit at home and do nothing, because sidatery lifestyle is bad for people health.
The third and the most compelling reason is that watching sports broaden your mind with different information not only about sport themes, but also about history, famous people, etc. In modern world it is necessary to have knowledge in different spheres of life, because nobody does not know where the life path will lead them to.
In conclusion, I would like to underline the importance of watching sport events, because it has a lot of advantages, such as being an interesting and exciting hobby, a way to spend free time usefully and broading mind horizons.
