Nowadays it is becoming more and more popular to watch sports among people. However, not everyone thinks that it is a good way to spend your time and I am agree with them. In this essay I would like to show my position.
On the one hand, there are so many ways to spend one's free time more beneficial than watching sports. For example, doing sport's activities is better for health than seating behind TV. The problem of obesity will be solved if a person will do this choose. Moreover, watching sport is a very emotional process and people often start to be so rude to others with no reasons. It is a common situation then a person start shouting or damaging something after his or her favourite team loss a game because he or she is very angry and mental unstable at that moment.
On the other hand, watching some sport's shows or events can be a good hobby and a way to be important in a social group for some people. There is a huge worldwide community of sport's fans and people who are in usually do not fell themselves alone. It is not rare then in such communities people fell themselves like a part of brotherhood and have very close relationships wuth their mates because of the same interest.
However, I am absolutely believe that spending time by watching sport is a waste of it. Sport's plays are more boring than interesting as you have to wait something unusual for so long, watching how, for example, footballers just running with a ball without any action.
To sum up, watching sport or not is an own choose of everyone. But in my opinion this kind of activity has much more minuses than pluses and do not suits me and my interests.
