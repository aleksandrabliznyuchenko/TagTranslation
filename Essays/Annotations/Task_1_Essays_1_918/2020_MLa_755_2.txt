It is argued by someone that spending time for watching the sports programms by any method - on television or face-to-face - killed free time. I completely disagree with this view and in this essay i will provide reasons to support my position.
One obvious argument for holding my opinion is that such activity can be one of the ways to spend time together with your friends or collegues and to maintain your favorite team. For example, two business partners encounter after difficult day, drink a beer and screaming together for the victory of the team. As a result, these business partnes may become more close, and wathcing the sport match can have a major positive influence in the foreeseable future (for instance, at work, briefings, meetings, conferences).
Another compelling reason for my position is that while teenagers and adults are interested in sports programms, they desired to be in shape and be dynamic. This is because sporting key figures and heroes are opinion leaders who can affect the most of people. These 'heroes' promote a healthy lifestyle, and also pass on knowledge of it.
Lastly, people wathcing sports spend their lives more physically actively. According to the scientific research, amount of members of gyms and sport centres tend to regularly increasing during the matches of Europe Cup Football championship. This is because the translation of famous sportsmen inspires persons and motivates them to develop the healthy lifestyle.
In conclusion, I totally agree with the opinion that sports games, matches and other programms impact on people's lives in positive way. It is a community bonding activity/. Moreover, it encourages persons for a healthy lifestyle.
