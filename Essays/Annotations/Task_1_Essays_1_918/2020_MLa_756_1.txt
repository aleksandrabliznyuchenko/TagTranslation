The first presented graph illustrates the statistics of using Facebook via different devices from 2012 to 2013. During the only one year the number of people who use this site with the help of desktop has decreased from 150 millions of users to almost 140 millions. This category lost almost one million of loyal users. At the same time it can bee seen that the way more people started to visit Facebook via their mobile phones - their number became almost 100 million users instead of almost 60 millions. It is remarkable that despite the fact of the rising popularity of mobile devices desktops are still the most popular technique used to spend time on Facebook.
As for the second chart, there is some difference in male and female reasons for using FaceBook. For example, more than a half of women asked are likely to use this site for sharing their photos and videos while only 39% of men do the same thing. At the same time both 39% of male and female respondents answered that their "main reason" for sitting on Facebook is receiving updates.
