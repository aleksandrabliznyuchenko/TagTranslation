Some people often consider that spending time watching sport programs is a waste of time. I completely disagree that watching sports can be just the way for killing time. First of all, I believe that watching sports can be really useful for your self-development. When you watch some game or race you start to understand the rules and that can be very utility at school, university or work. You can also need such information while you talk to your friends and colleagues. In that situation person who watch sport programs can support the conversation. For example, we can imagine a situation when you talk to a person who is a big fan of hockey. If you watch some sports you probably heard some rues or news about this type of sport and you will support the conversation.
Secondly, you can learn more about team work and cooperation while watch some sport programs. Team sports usually show how team mates communicate with each other. Children can learn from team sports how to behave in a group of people, so i think it is very useful to watch sport programs.
To conclude, I strongly believe that there is nothing bad in watching sport programs. On the contrary, it can give you a lot of new interesting information and it is always a good way to spend your free time.
