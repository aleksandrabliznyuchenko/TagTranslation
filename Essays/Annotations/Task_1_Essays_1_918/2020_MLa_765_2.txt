Nowadays a lot of people are obsessed with observing sports through the TV, but some people argue and tell that it is a waste of time. From my personal point of view, it is a controversial issue, which I would like to discuss in this essay.
From watching sports people can get enjoy and satisfaction. Observing people, how they play can be really interesting. For example, people can have a favourite stortsman, they can look for a new information about his life. Therefore, on the match people can have not only sympathy but also empathy: cheering up a sportsman is kind of ritual, when this man becomes a winner, people also are happy with his achivement.
On the one hand, watching sports gives people emotions and other mental features, but on the other hand, this leads to laziness and also stress. Firstly, people waste their time by watching translation for hours without any physical movements. This can lead to health problems, for example, gaining heavy weight, decrease body activities and other health issues, including problems with heart and muscle system. Moreover, it can be stressful also for a mental health and relationship between people. For instance, if a man do not like your choice in sports (for example, he do not like football, but you do), you will argue about it with him and, therefore, there can be agression and misunderstanding. As a result, people do not get a compromise and damage their relationship.
In conclusion I would like to say that watching sports is not a crime, everyone can do that. For some people it can be interesting, for some not, everyone choose their own path.
