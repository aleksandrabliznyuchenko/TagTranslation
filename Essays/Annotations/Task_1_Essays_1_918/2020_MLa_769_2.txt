Nowadays there are a lot of argues about this statement: watching some sport matches, sport news are wasting of people's time, because they are able to do a lot of useful things. As for my opinion, I am totally agree with this suggestion: a person can read some books, visit theirs friends and relatives, go to the fitness center and other stuff.
There are many advantages of not wasting your time on watching some sport stuff either on TV or at live sports events. First of all, you can watch sport events online. During watching sport events and news online people can do several things. For example, a person can to go to the gym, do some exersices like cardio training and watch a basketball match on the phone, compared to only watching spots indoors.
