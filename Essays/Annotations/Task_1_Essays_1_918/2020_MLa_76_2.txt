There is a point of view that people who watch sports at live matches or on TV translations waste their time. In my opinion, despite the lake of time which people spend near the TV, watching sports is not just wasting the time. On the one hand, each process of watching sports, from my standpoint, can be the part of human's life and can takes a lot of time if the person agrees to it. To start with, sports give a lot of positive emotions for them who is crazy about any kind of sport an is involved in it. Also watching sports can delay and push you to start doing it yourself, maintaining your health and physical shape. Furthermore, sportsmanship unites people and helps you to find new friends. All of sport fans usually communicate in groups and spend a lot of time doing other activities together, which are not connected with sport.
On the other hand, watching sports can take a lot of time and it cab be bad for work or study.
In conclusion, people should allocate their time correctly so that their hobby of watching sports does not become a waste of time.
