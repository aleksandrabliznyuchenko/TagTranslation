A number of people consider watching sports to be a useless way of spending free time. But as far as I am concerned, person can choose how to spend his or her spare time however they like if it brings joy to them.
Firstly, person can have some kind of sport as a hobby, so watching sports can be some kind of tutorial for them. They can learn how to make it better by examining the techniques of professionals in the sphere they are into. For instance, a boy have football as a hobby. He wants to improve his skills in dealing with a ball. By watching football on TV or live, he is observing the way professional football players are doing tricks and dealing with opponents. After that, he can repeat some useful strategies and boost his own skills.
Secondly, watching sports can be a way of relaxation for some people. If a person worked hard during all week, they deserve to have a rest whatever way they prefer. If they tend to relief stress and relax by just watching basketball or football with a glass of beer (maybe even with a friend or a member of a family), they have to do it to repair their mental and physical state. For example, when a farher of 3 children work hard on a manufactory 6 days a week, he can have a rest in the evening by watching his favourite team playing tonight. He will have a bunch of emotions, switch of the reality for several hours and just wash his tiredness off. Additionaly, if he is watching match with a friend, son of wife, it is also a pleasant way to communicate and gain relaxation and positive emotions.
To conclude, watching sports is a pretty common way to spend free time among millions of people. Despite some individuals are concerned that it is a useless activity, I believe that if watching sports brings joy, then can be a great way to relive stress, communicate with the loved ones or improving skills by copying tricks of professionals.
