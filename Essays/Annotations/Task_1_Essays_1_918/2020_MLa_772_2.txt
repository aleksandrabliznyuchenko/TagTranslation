Some people consider that watching different kinds of sport on TV or be a visitor of sport event is a waste of time probably because you should spend your free time doing something more dispelling, for example: study different languages, doing sport of your own, spend time with family or friends.
But the other people very like to watch different kinds of sport on TV or in real life because it is really interesting for them. This kind of people give positive emotions while they watching sport: football, tennis, swimming or something else.
I think that watching sports on TV or in real life it is not a waste of time for several reasons. First of all, every person have a own free time and he should spend it on that he likes, because thanks for that it is possible to do a happy man. And it is really important to do something to make you happy. Besides, watching sport can be a hobby and a person could communicate with other people who watch sport as hobby too. It is a good way to find new friends or company. Also, watching sport can be a family tradition, for example: the father and his sun watch football together every weekends. The last but not the list reason why watching sport is a great idea is a possibility of the appearance of motivation for playing sports. For example, my brother in their childhood really often watched the tennis on TV and he asked mother to began play tennis. Now he plays tennis every day and takes a part in tennis tournament.
Overall, i think that it is not right to consider that watch sport on TV or on sport event is waste of time. As for me, watching sport has a lot of advantages, for example: making new friends or enjoying moments of watching.
