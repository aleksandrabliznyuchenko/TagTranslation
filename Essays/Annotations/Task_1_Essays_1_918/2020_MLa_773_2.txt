Nowadays millions of people gatter to watch major sport events and cheeer for their favorite teams either online, on TV or live. Despite it being a very popular hobby and pasttime, some will argue that dedicating time to spectate sports is just wasting time. I desagree with this point of view.
Fist of all, sports can be considered as very important part of many people's lives. Whether they do it professionaly, just for fun, or just enjoy watching, they still may relate to it greatly and reregard it as a part of who they are, just as they would do with any other hobby (take reading, watching movies and so on). In fact, simply spectating a sports game can make one feel as a member of a team. For example, football fans always cheer for their teams, celebrate their wins and get over losses together. This helps build a sense of being a part of something great and cannot a waste of time. Secondary, there are cases when watching a sport becomes the only option. There are people who cannot do sports, and there are sports can not be done by everyone. People with disabilities would not be able to do some sports, but they might still want to watch it. For example, some former athelets who are no longer able to do sport due to injuries will not miss a single event, because it is something to valuable to them. Moreover, there are sports that require special equipment, that is not available to everyone. A good illustration of this would be equine sport.
In conclusion, there is so much more to watching sports than some people might think, when they call it a waste of time. Sports lovers find joy in seeing their favourite team win and celebrate it with fellow fans, and for someone, who cannot play sports themselves, watching it becomes a precious pasttime.
