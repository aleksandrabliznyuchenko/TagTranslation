Now we live in the age when people claim that watching sporting events is a time killing. I am completelly disagree with this point of view and i am sure that it is a useful activity and has many advantages of its own. In this essay, I will provide several arguments to support my opinion.
First and foremost, watching sports help people live a healthier life. Therefore, sports events encourage its viewers to stay fit and people tend to start doing physicall activities. For instance, recent study showed that in Russia teenagers are inspired by their sport heroes. Moreover, 30% of young people have chosen their career path as a football players based on their sporting idol Cristiano Ronaldo. They explained this choice as a consequence of watching live sports events at the stadium or on TV with their parents in their childhood. In the contrast, watching other television shows as Comedy Club does not provide people with the effect of motivating and inspiring. Besides, such shows only increase the predisposition to clip thinking among teenagers.
Secondly, watching sport provide people with an opportunity to gain together and cheer for the favourite team. Undoubtedly, fans may have different points of view on a life in general: different religious or moral ideology or they may differ in the age or in a social status. However, while watching sports, all of the fans are united by a common goal and desire of the winning. Thus, sporting events bring people closer and help them overcome the differences and prejudices. Moreover, when the team of their country wins in international competition, the celeberation even cause patriotic feelings in fans.
To sum up, watching sports have a several pluses. It improves community bonding among the fans and impacts positively on a youth by encouraging and motivating them to choose a healthy lifestyle and engage in physical activities as a member of sporting events.
