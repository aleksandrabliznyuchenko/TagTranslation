There is an opinion that watching sports in any way is a bad way to spend your time. As a sportsman myself, i disagree with this position.
Firstly, watching sports may not be as hard as doing sports, but it is a great way to have fun with your friends and chill after a hard day. It is not news that sport connetcts people from different countires, ethnicities and backgrounds.
Secondly, sports need audience. If there is no audience, there is no money, if there is no money, there is no way of paying for expencive stadium or for free courses for children.
Finally, it is the inspiration. Watching sports on tv or at the stadium may be a great way to inpire one to become a sportsman or to be more persistent in ones own dreams, because we see people who would train every day for several hours a day to be seen on tv.
In conclusion, doing sports may have it's own advantages, but it is not correct to ignore advantages of watching sports.
