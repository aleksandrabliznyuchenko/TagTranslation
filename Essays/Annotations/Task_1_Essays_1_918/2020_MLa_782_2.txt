Nowadays there is an opinion: people said that process of watching sports on TV or at live sports events is a waste of time. Obviously, i can agree with this statement by two main reasons. In this essay i will talk about the useless of such kind of rest among TV.
To start with, there are two main causes not to waste time by this way. And the first is a lack of real emotions from sport. I am confident that when people have an opportunity to visit some event, they should not to lose it. For example, my family prefer to buy tickets on Prodigy concert and visit such performance, because they get awesome memories and emotions from this day. So, TV sports or some events like this will never compare with a real performance because of memories.
Hence, there are another cause to agree with our statement. From my point of view, TV watching is a really bad wasting of time, because people could learn something new in this period (for example, to get a knowledge about some interesting sport) and not to less eyes health while this process. So, TV watching is a loose of many opportunities for people nowadays.
To sum up, there are two main causes that watching sports on TV is a very bad waste of time and people shouldn't do this. I confident that such time spending can be more useful, even if human want to learn something new about sport. I hope that many of us will not waste time by this way in near future..
