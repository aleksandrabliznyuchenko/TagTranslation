Nowadays many people love sport. Furthermore, a lot of people prefer not only playing in this, but and watching this on the TV or at live sport events. It is argued by some that spending free time by watching sport action in the all way is a killing time and people have not benefits after this. I totally disagree with this opinion and in this essay I will state the reason for my point of view.
The most compelling reason for holding my point of view is that watching sport on television or at live sports events is an perfect opportunity for people to come together and cheer for their team. For example, all sports funs famous with the help of their strong support. Fans watching the game together may have nothing similar, like different life status or different religions beliefs etc. Although, when they watch the game, they have only one concern and they looking at the same direction because all of they want one thing for their team-win. Sports events bring people closer and help forgot about their differences. When the team wins, its means that all of their fans will celebrate this.
Another reason for my point is that when people have idol or person which their like it is perfect especial if this person from sport.. They feel encouraged to stay fit and well-being with healthy life. For instance, teenagers adore sporting heroes and goes in sport because they want be like their favourite athlete. British scientists learned that there was about 25% increase in gym membership after every Olympic game. Nevertheless, when people watching some programme with little part of sport on the TV during their free time does not so inspired for changing their lifestyle.
In conclusion, I totally agree that watching sports is not a waste of time. It can motivate people start to do sport. Constantly, live healthier life. Sport is also desirable way for make better relation with another people.
