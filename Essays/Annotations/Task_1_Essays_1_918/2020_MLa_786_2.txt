In our modern world we have a very fast rithm of life. The knowledge of finding the balance between work and relax plays a significat role in our life. Some people think that the process of watching how other play on sport is a waste of time, while others, icluding me, strongly dissagree with them.
First of all, watching sports on TV or at live events is one of the way to spending time with your friends. After hard working week people have a chance to seat around the TV and have a great time, while watching and discussion. For instance, we have a tradition in our family. Every Sunday all members of our family go to the biggest stadium in our aria for watching the game between two bascketball teams.
Secondly, the process of watching makes people feel as one big community. The great example for this argument is The World Footbal Game. The huge number of people around the world came to Russia for waching football. Moreover, they felt like the big family with one main idea - win.
However, despite this facts some people believe that watching sports is a waste of time. From their point of view, it is a weak idea to seat and watch how other people do something. Moreover, they prefer to play by themselves. For instance, my classmate hate to watch the game, he always wants to be a part of team. But not everyone can take a part of sport game.
To sum up, I would like to underline It is important to respect other people's opinion, however I am strongly convinced that despite some critical views it is difficult to avoid the fact that watching sports is not a waste of time.
