The graph clearly shows that the use of Facebook has declined in a year and the use of the desktop version of Facebook has decreased dramatically in March 2013 in comparison to March 2012. There are several points that should be taken into account while trying to explain the difference.
Considering that women thought sharing photos or videos is, apparently, the most crucial reason for using the social media, one should understand that the action is much easier when using a mobile phone. While men did not seem as enthusiastic as women about it, the explanation also stands in their case. Recieving updates does not have a difference in percentage of the answers given by either male of female users. It still might be a good reason for using a mobile phone rather than a computer, because the mobile phones get instant automatic updates.
The eight percent gap states that the 'Seeing funny posts' feature was more appealing to women than to men. A mobile phone makes the feature more accessible. Learning ways to help others has the lowest support among both men and women, yet women are still more interested in that than men are, as the considerable ten percent gap suggests.
Generally, it can be seen that female Facebook users are presumably heavier users of the social platform than men.
