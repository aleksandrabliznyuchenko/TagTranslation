There is a popular opinion, that wathing sports is not a very good way to spend time. Personally, I disagree with this position and I will explain my piont of view.
First of all, watching sports is a good option to spend you free time. You shouldn't work or increase your skills all time, you always need to relax and chill. At that time you can play video games, wathing news or sports on TV. Moreover, watching sports is a cool way of spending time with friends, especially if they like sports. There is no such a good thing in the world as collect all your friends in your house, made delicious BBQ and watch football together, or met up in a bar and raise cups for a win of favourite team.
Despite this, some people don't agree with that. They say that there are more intellectual options to relax, such as playing board games or chess. But not all people want they brain to work so hard when they are relaxing, especially if their work connected with using brains, not physical strength.
Therefore, some people have opinion that it will be better to spend free time outdoors, playing sport games itself, riding a bike e.t.c. But if your work conneted with using physical strength, you can need relaxation for all parts of your body, and wathing sports while sitting on your favorite sofa is one of the best ways in that case.
To conclude, I want to say that we live in a free society and it will be the best if a person can choose options to spending their free time itself. Let's stop criticizing each other for the ways we relax and chill. Every person can be interested in different things and it is not bad. That's why I think watching sports is not a waste of time and none of typical ways of spending free time are waste of time either.
