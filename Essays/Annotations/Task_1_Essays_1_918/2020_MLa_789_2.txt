There are a lot of opinions on such topic as watching sports. Some people believe that it is an entertainment and there is nothing wrong about spending time in front of TV or at football fields, for example. Other people claim that it is a waste of time and watching sport games is useless. Personally, I think that this kind of activity is very interesting and could be motivating sometimes.
Watching sports is like watching a TV show. But this show is about real people who worked hard to get in this game or competition. So it really is motivational to understand that people on a screen, a field or an ice ring are real. They make viewers think, 'if they could do it, i can achieve this too'. So, it is impossible to call something that important a waste of time. Moreover, watching sports could be a great reason to get people together. There are a lot of families that assembles while watching TV and cheering their favourite team. Some people ask others to go on a date with them by buying two tickets on a sport event. This is an ice breaker for couples. The last but not least, some people watch sports to let themselves scream out their emotions. There are not that much social situations that allow you scream on the top of your lungs. But it is absolutely okay on a sport event.
In conclusion, i would like to say that everyone finds something good in watching sports. People use those events to get closer with their families or significant others and get motivated. Any activity that is found interesting, useful or enjoyable can not be considered a waste of time.
