Over recent years people have become more addicted and demanding to their free time facility. While there are those who think that watching sports either on TV or at live sports arenas is a waste of time, I am of the opinion that such leisure activity is a useful spending of your free time. In my essay I will try to justify my point of view. (66).
Watching sports has several convincing arguments in favour of a effective time spending. First of all, by doing this the person will be able to reduce the ones stress level, because such events are made for giving effort and emotions. As a result, people can show higher performance at their work or studies. (129). Furthermore, recent statistics has shown that those who are interested in sports and watch it on daily basis have better social and communicative connections that affect their life in positive way. (160).
On the other hand, those who agree that watching sports is a waste of time commonly believe that there are plenty different leisure activities that have more benefits, for example self-education and crafts. (193). Moreover, with a tremendous development of technologies, a person can consume time and check the results of the game or competition immediately. (215).
To conclude, I would like to say that I totally disagree that watching sports is a useless waste of time. Such activity can give a person a sense of unity with the supporters and broadens the worldview and circle of interests.
