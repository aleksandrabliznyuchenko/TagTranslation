It would seem nowadays that people consider that fans who watch sport competitions on TV or at live events are wasting time. I completely disagree with this statement. In my opinion, it is a good way to learn, relax and have fun without going outside or training.
First of all, sport programms can be a good lesson for a sportsman. High quality picture with instant comments from TV-host can bring a good portion of information that can be remembered and used afterwards. For example, young generation loves to watch football matches on the TV. They watch it to mimic some techniques during their games and to impress trainers with it. Practice makes perfect and young players can see the result of long trainings and years of hardwork that their idols did to reach the success.
Secondly, live sport events or even sports on TV give people time to relax and have fun. They can not only watch the game but also try to predict the numbers of goals, minutes or the ending result. There is nothing wrong with wasting your time for a relaxation because our bodies and minds need this. Productivity is a bad thing when we spent to much time thinking about it. Although, watching sports can be inappropriate in some cases, most of the time it is a good way to experience the rush of adrenaline without putting pressure on the body.
In conclusion, watching sports on TV or live is not a waste of time. It is a good way to provide people with a quality source of information and fun. The beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. Some people can see a good sides of the entertainment and find a way to use collected information in the real life.
