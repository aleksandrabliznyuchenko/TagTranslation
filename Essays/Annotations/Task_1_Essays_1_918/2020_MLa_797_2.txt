There are many sports chanels and events. A lot of people love it and watch sports every weekend. There are also people who believe that watching sports events is waste of time. I disagree with this opinion.
To begin with, sports is a kind of relax for a large number of people. They usually go home after their work, switch TV on and watch how theit favourite team plays. It is not waste of time, because it is a way not to think about their problems, work and other things that they care about. For some people it is computer games, for others it is watching films, therefore we can not judge thouse who love sports events. It is kind of human nature.
Secondly, sports events could be a kind of hobby. This is illustrated by the fact that a lot of fans usually make bets, like in casino. It could be waste of money but not a waste of time. There are also many fan communities and people who go to every game of their favourite team. For those people every weekend is a celebration. Moreover, people over the world like big football cups like world cup, because there is a fantastic atmothphere and I understand why people spend a lot of time and money for it.
There are also opponents of my opinion. They claim that people could spend to much time for sports events and they do not need that amount of relax. The fact that people spend all weekend to go for a football match illustrates this statement.
In conclusion I would like to state that watching sports is a kind entertainment like watching films and go shoping. Some fans spend too much time for it, but i think there is nothing in it.
