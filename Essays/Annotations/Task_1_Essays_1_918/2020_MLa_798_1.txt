The first bar chart shows us the difference between the number of people who used the Facebook from Desktop or Mobile Devise in comparing between 2012 and 2013 years. We can see that at 2012 people mostly used the Desktop to visit the Facebook than the Mobile devise: about 150 millions of users chose the Desktop while only 59 millions chose Mobile phone. In 2013 it's different: around 130 millions of people chose Desktop in comparing with 99 millions who chose Mobile device. Using the desktop was still the most common, but the number of using Mobile Devises increased.
Then, the second bar chart shows as the people preferences of reasons for using Facebook compared between women and men. We may see that receiving updates is same important for sexes. But in other reasons to use that social network percentage of man was more than women. But still men and women both prefer using that network for sharing photos or videos rather than using it for seeing funny posts or learning about ways to help.
Both charts are interesting to anylise!
