Some people say that watching sports is useless. They mean that nobody can became good at sport only by watching how others perform it. But a lot of people watch sports not only for getting better in exercises or to became a professionals. So what do watching sport events give to people? Is that really useful or not?
On the one hand, sport programmes make people feel excited and extremely interested in results of competitions. People watch those competitions because it gives them a lot of emotions - we can compare it to watching a movie or visit the theatre. People can get together to watch the sport events and spend an extra time with each other. Also sport can make people feel proud of their countries - for example, during the Olympic Games in 2018 in Russia people were celebrating on the streets each win on their teams. Or parties that men and women make while watching the Football World Cup competition. Also, we shouldn't forget that all professional sportsmen have to watch competitions in their own sport to anylise them and become better and better in it. So, watching sports can be very useful and can bring a lot of good emotions to people.
On the other hand, watching sport programmes or live sports events is not equal to practise the sport. If you will be only watching how other people do a type sport, you wont get better in it. If somebody is the begginer in some sort of sport It's as much important for him/her to anylize the professional's work as to practise it by himself.
In conclusion, I want to say that people can do anything they want: sport events exists because somebody wants to see them. And if watching sports makes you excited or it helps you to develop your skills - watch it! Personally I prefer to watch those events only to spend time with my friends or relatives (like when my father is watching football on TV) and that makes me feel better.
