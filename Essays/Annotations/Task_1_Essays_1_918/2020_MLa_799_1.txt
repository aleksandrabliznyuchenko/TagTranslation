The graph shows us that number of people accessing their Facebook account from desktop decreased between march 2012 and march 2013. Shift of audience between two platforms can be seen with ease, as number of people using Facebook with their mobile phones in 2013 almost doubling numbers in 2012. However, mobile platform is gaining popularity at a faster pace, than desktop loosing it. This means that total number of people somehow using Facebook does not stay the same. In fact, it grew by 15 million from march 2012 to march 2013. Which is largely due to rapid increase in mobile phone users numbers.
Other tendencies that graph is illustrating is the difference in user experience of women and men. It is seen that sharing photos and videos is more relevant to female audience, as this is the type of use in wichh difference between men and women can be seen plainly. Man are using Facebook to share photo and video content 15% less often as graph shows us with female numbers at 54% and male numbers at 39%. Another large disparity, second to only photos is learning capablities of Facebook which women are more likely to use. Here we can see that men are prone to learn something only in 25% cases compared to 35% in case of women. In fact, in every category apart from receing updates women are using Facebook more. This can be seen is funny post category, however, here difference is not that big compared to 15% in photos and videos. By far the most closest competition is in the receing updates user case, as it is the only reason that men and women are equally likely to state as their answer.
