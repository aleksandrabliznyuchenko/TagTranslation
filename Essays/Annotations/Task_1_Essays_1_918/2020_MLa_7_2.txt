Nowadays there is a meaing that wathind sports is not considered as a good leisture In my opinion, despite of some disadvantages, I do not agree with the statement.
First of all, couples, families and friends have a great time attending live sport events. They watch real match, communicate with each other and have fun either they come to cheer on their favourite team or just spend time with a good company.
Every people who relaite to some kind of sport, would like to watch the matches on real life or on TV. They do this for developing skills, and just for interest. For example, in the childhood I did shooting, now I have not oppotunities to have time for sport. The only one way how I can keep connect with shooting watching olimpiades and competitions on the TV.
On the other hand, lots of people just not interested in sport. For them watching is real waste of time In concludion, I am convinced that watching sport events is nise way to spend time, either it is home wathing or attending a real event it has a lot of benefits and advantages.
