Sport is a central part in life of every person, it makes us stronger physically and mentally. Some people suppose that doing sport and watching it are two different things, because watching it is useless. I want to disagree with this statement.
From my point of view, it is extremely important to watch sport games, especially sport translations on TV or through the Internet. It is important for those, who do sport on their own, professionally or not, because it helps you to learn from other people's experience. On the screen you can see their failures and wins and, using this knowledge, creat your strategy in sport. In sport game you have to use not only your body but also brain. Watching sport matches teaches you what is effective in the game, what is not. You can be a better player after it.
Watching sports can become a motivation for you to develop your personality in general. Examples of sportmen can inspire you to start something new and be a better version of yourself. on the main sport events audience often can see the tears, injuries, bad weather but nothing can stop sportmen to join the game. Also, it is important for the audience to see a loyal team, protective coach and to feel the atmosphere of cooperation. You understand that you are a part of something big and this feeling inspires you to start to go ahead. I know a lot of examples of people who was one day inspired of strong sport personality and after that start own career, Leo Messi, for instance.
I am sure people should watch sport games. It is useful not only for entertainment but also for personality. I think that everything should be normal, it is scary when people always watch it on their sofa with a beer and do nothing. For those who understand watching sport games positively it is a good form of self-development.
