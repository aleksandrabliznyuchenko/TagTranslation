Nowadays people have many different kinds of entertainment. One of the most popular ones is sport. But many people consider it as a useless action that waste a lot of your time. In the following essay I will try to find some pros and cons to that position.
Those one who are against watching sports events have a point. If you are just watching a match lying in your bed and doing nothing else you will not have any profits from that. Secondly government spent a lot of money to Olympiads, other big sports events and sport teams. And I agree that money could be better used for building hospitals or improving school technical equipment. So the last popular idea is that many types of sport are very bloody, painful for sportsmen and it is not the thing that need to be so popular.
Nevertheless there are reasons why watching sport is good. First of all many great sportsmen wrote in their biographies that their careers started from watching some kind of a TV show. So "sport propaganda" can help some kids to find out what they are passion about. And it is common knowledge that big sport events like Olympiads always lead to increasing number of people who starts doing exercises. The last but not the least, speaking about sports I need to speak about adrenaline too. Both sportsmen and cheerios have a lot of adrenaline in their organism during the sports events. And many people love sport for that feeling, because it helps them to forget about their own problems and jobs, they become a part of a noisy crowd.
In conclusion I would like to say that I personally think that people can love anything they want. Nobody makes you watch sport channels. All people have their own hobbies, you do not need to love it but you need to respect it.
