Altought theare some arguments, that watching sports is a waste of time, I prefer view, that watching sports events help us in the our live. For example, when I wathcing bicycle sports, I can fugure out whith a new for me riding technics. Also, I can seeing chess that works as training for my brain. Often some sport events is like film. But I don't know people, that thinking, that going to the cinema is a waste of time as well. In my view, watching sports can be funny or can be like learning videos in this sport.
But in the same time, I can understand the opposite viewing. Often the fans watching sports like football. And when intelagance people seeing football fans, theare behavare, they can have bad experince with sport's area. In my opinion, we need to separate just watching events and fans, when talking about sports. Also, if you don't like any kind of sport, you will not like sport's programm. But it's not my way - I like sport.
Altought, for some people wathcing sports can be a waste of time, there a lot of people, that need and love it: sportsmen or fans. You can seeing whatever you want, all programms and event will be a waste of time for somebody - it's okay.
