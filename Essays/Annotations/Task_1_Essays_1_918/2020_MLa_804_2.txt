According to some people, watching live sport events is just waste of time. However i disagree with this opinion because there it has many benefits such as iner relaxation.
To begin with every person got his own time waster which helps him to regenerate his energy. Some of them prefer singing, some watching films or making reviews and some are just want to watch the stream of match of his favorite team. That helps people move away from their problems and rutine. Moreover watching live events with out friends brings us closer and makes our love stronger.
Secondary most of news are based on sport tournaments. And people who wasted their free time for this activity know some information before it going to be post. However watching professional games makes you better in this sport. For example every chess or wolleyball play nust watch tournaments replays for know some now strateges.
Over all watching sports is a good time spending. And i recomend encourage sport children to watch every event of their favourite sport.
