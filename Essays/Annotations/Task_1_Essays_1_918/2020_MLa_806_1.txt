During the last decade, The Internet has changed crucially. Some services gained enormous amounts of customers while others lose theirs. As an example, we can see the change of of use of Facebook social network in 2012-2013. The greatest change can be seen in platform change of some users: as an impact of spontaneous advancements in technology and mobile phones becoming "smarter" and more common lots of people started using Facebook on mobile insted of computers. While general amount of Facebook users has contranted slightly, it is clearly visible it got significant amount of new customers using mobile platform. We can try to find reasons of general loss on the second graph. Facebook is known to be a "universal" network for having all the variety of features needed for on-line communication, yet most of people use for something particular. For example, much less people use Facebook in 2013 for sharing media or entertainment. I may suppose it is not due to lesser demand in such activities, rather i think it is because the development of other services (such ac Instagram or Twitter), which specialise more on one particular feature, getting more audience of the same interest, and also Facebook becoming much less "unique" in it's way. In spite of all that, we can see Facebook succeeds in keeping the audience preferring "updates recieveng" - their part has not changed at all. In conclusion I can say that the Internet changes very fast nowadays and companies need to advance their services too if they want to keep audience and profitability.
