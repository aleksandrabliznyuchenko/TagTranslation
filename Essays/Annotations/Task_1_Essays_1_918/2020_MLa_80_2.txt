I think that it is better for a person to go in for sports himself, for example, I am a master of sports in athletics, but i wuuld be interested to watch a program or live broadcast on athletics. In any case, this activity will be useful, it can motivate a person, teach him to empathize with other athletes. There are many people in the world who think that it is a waste of time to watch sports events. They usually think that if a person likes a certain sport, then he is beteer off doing it himselfthan lookinng at others. For some, watching movies is a waste of time. for others, reading books is a waste of time. I am a big fan of Sports. I cannot miss out on any matches that my beloved teams play. I will cancel them live. Sports is a very important part of my life. I hsve always been into sports since I was 10. I have also represented my school in Sports Quiz competitions. I have played Football, Cricket, Athletics in school. For a person not having interest in something, it is a waste of time for him. It's a wwaste of time for him, it's a waste of time if you don't enjoy it. Leisure time is just as important as studying. If you neglect it then you will and up berned out quickly which you need to avoid to de successful later in life.
