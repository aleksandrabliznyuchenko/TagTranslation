It is true that some people believes that watching sports is a waste of time. However, there is an opinion that it is wrong. I think that watching sports is good pastimes, it is not a waste. I will consider both opinions.
On the one hand, some ideas that people who watch sports wasting their time. Yes, in this time people do nothing although they can done a lot of things: work, homework, study and other. Sometimes people eat fastfood (cheeps, popcorn and other) when they see a sport because they harm own body.
On the other hand, some view that watching sports is a good time. Some people receive many emotions, charge for energy and perhaps the desire to engage sports. Also if see sports on a stadion that it feels a great atmosphere and sporting spirit. Somebody do sport begin after spectacular sport actions and children begin own career. Actually, some parents choose kind of sport for their children because they watching sport.
In conclusion, watching sport is a good time for relax and hobby but if you watching sport then you should a healthy lifestyle lead. Else it is a double standards.
