Some people contend that wathing sports is a waste of time. I don't accept this view, but I undertand this opion.
People who see what don't need wath sports are one major arguments. Time what you wath events you can for exemple do work, meet friens and family or do sport.
It is true what people whath sports don't work in this time, but they can meet freinds and together wath sports events and support favorite comand or person. If you do sport in professinal wathing helped him undertand what need or don't need doing in events and find people like you.
In conclusion I think what everyone person should understand for samself need wath sport or it is a waste of time.
