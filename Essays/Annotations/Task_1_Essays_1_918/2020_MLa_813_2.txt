I mostly agree with this statement. First of all, sport fans who watch sport events can use this time for improving themselves in sport and physical form. Instead of it they often have a passive lifestyle included smoking, drinking alcohol spirits and eating not so healthy food such as cheaps, lemonades an other snacks.
Have you noticed the advertisment while the match is had been going? The Lay's cheaps is an regular sponsor of football games. So I don't think that big sport really pushes healthy style of life. Sport clubs, tournirs and world cups are interested in increasing benefits but not in the happyness of spectators.
Some information which I have about football fans movement shows me that sport is not the main goal of fans. They are often take a part in hooligan movement and they are really captivated in street fightings. So this also forms not so healthy image of a usual football fan.
Also a lots of sports spectators understand that they will never be as successfull as professional players. So this knowlage can encourage not a lot of of watchers, I think. To achieve such success you need to have a lot of hard trainings and an special diet wich may be not so healthy.
On the other hand sport events may translate and example of carier achievement and sport principals of live. Sport stars can encourage people to chose their kind of sport.
But in my example I can say that neither sport events that I have wathched in real life neither I have wathched on TV did impress me a lot and encourage me to chose any kind of sport. I dont' like doing sport unless my parents are fans and I often watch translations with them.
