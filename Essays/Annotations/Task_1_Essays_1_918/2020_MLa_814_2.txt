Nowe days there are hundreds of differet sports. Each of them got it's oun oudience. However some people belive, that watching sports, no metter on the TV or live, is a useful waste of time. On the one hand, people that think that wathing sport is useful, are right in the way that watching sports will not give knledge ore skillse. Wathing sports will not macke you better at the particular sport ither stronger or healthiar. It is onely the way to spend your time a lot of time, that fanes spend infronte of a TV. The time that they could spend mor rationaly. Whats more, sometimes watching sport live can be dangerouse because of agresive fanes of an oposite or iven your team.
On the other hand, watching sport togeather with friends ore relatives is a good way of spending your leaser time. Children folow fawrit times with there parents that makes them closer to each other. Sport events are alsow a good reasone fore frieds to get all together feal the same emotiones talk about favourite sport. Alsow if you like to watch sport, you are more likly to try it.
As for me, I can't agry with thouse, who doesnt like wathing sports. From my early childhood I did a lot of sports: footbal, swimming, shou jumping and so on, but not onely plaing sport was enteresting for me but also wathing it. I belive that wathing sports is as importent for me as plaing it. There is no dought that watching sports helped me a lot in my live.
