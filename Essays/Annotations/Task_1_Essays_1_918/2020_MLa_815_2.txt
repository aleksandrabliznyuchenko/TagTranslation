Some people opine that watching sports wastes our time. It's not matter if it is a live sport event ot TV show. I can't agree with them.
First and foremost I'd like to say that the sport area is a real culture. The fan-clubs is a great community, where you can find frinds. As for me, I met with my best friend on a party which was organised because of the winning of our school volleyball team.
The second reason is increasing of our brain links. Of course, I'd like to discuss the people who is thinking about the staratage, position in competition table and so on.
However, to my mind, the main aim is emotioms. It's so important fo me not to leave bad feelings inside of me: i spend my time with the favourite sportsmen. I laught with them, I cri with them. So these competitions are my oun phycologists.
Summarise, watching sports can be usefull. It depend on your own position and principles.
