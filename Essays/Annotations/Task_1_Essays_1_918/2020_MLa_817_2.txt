There are many people who tend to belive that time is used uneffectively while watching spots events. However, there can be an alternative belief, that is why in oder to decide which side to take, it is important to analyze both sides of view.
On the one hand, it can not be denyed that TV shows and sports events are time-consuming. In some cases, big championships last for weeks. Therefore, people have to bring their attention to such events not only during the evening, but also through long period of time. As a silent example, football Champions League cathes attention of millions of people slightly longer than two months. From my expeience, such big sport events became a really long-awaited.
On the other hand, it is worth mentioned that watching sports lively on TV is a way of pass the time with pleasure and have a rest after a hard day or even week. On numeos occasions, the whole family unites at the family dinner and watches sports on TV while communicating with each other and having a great time. From my experience, such evenings warms the soul even when the evening is ower and became an important part of the memories. Another argument in favor of watching sports is the fact that a person can not only have a positive emotions during the process of watching, but also gets an inspiration to go to the fitness club and became a part of this sport industry. From my perspective, spots events greatly motivates people to take care of their health. Therefore, it can not be a waste of time, if even one person got inspired.
In conclusion, it is evident from the discussion that arguments for the both sides of view are fairly strong, and neither can be neglected. From my perspective, each individual has a right to choose the most favorable way to spend free time, but watching TV and live sports events is also a great opportunity to have a pleasant time.
