It is argued that the entertainment activities associated with sports, for instance watching online translations or attending live sports events, are time-wasting. This essay disagrees with this idea because watching sports events can develop one's social skills and help to relief stress.
Nowadays, sports have become not only a hobby or a well-paid job but also a subject of mutual interest between thousands of people. Consequently, it is easier for sports lovers to build social networks by making new aquaintance and develop social skills while discussing their favourite footbal team's game on special website or while meeting new people with the comparable interests when attending a sports event. There are tons of examples when total strangers managed to become close friends, or even lovers, after having understood that they both genuinely enjoy watching sports or support the similar football team.
More than that, a proccess of watching sports can be a good way of relaxation and stress relief. The number of happiness hormones, which people excrete when celebrating their beloved athelete's or team's win, is incommensurable with one when reading a book or strolling in the park. Therefore, due to the exsitence of online translations and free sports oriented TV channels, this is probably the easiest and the cheapest way to relax, satisfy one's needs and get away from it all.
To conclude, there is an opinion that watching sport activities is a passive occupation and a waste of time. However, arguments for watching sports outweigh those against. Not only do sports events help to improve somebody's social life but they also remain the simpliest way to recharge and gain some positive energy.
