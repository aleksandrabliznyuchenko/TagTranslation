The graphs present information on means and reasons of Facebook use among men and women in the period of 2012 - 2013.
As it can be seen from the first graph, the amount of mobile phone users in 2013 is twice the amount of users in 2012. Consequently, the amount of desktop users had slightly declined from 150 to approximately 135 million users.
Judging by the information provided in the second graph, women are 15% more willing to share photos than men. However, sharing photos is yet one of the most popular reasons for men, alongside receiving updates. Seeing funny posts comes a close second for both genders, reaching 43% of women and 35% of men users.
From the information provided by the graphs, one can possibly assume that the main reason for an increased use of mobile phones as a means of accessing Facebook is the ability to take and share photos instantly. Whereas desktop viewing might be easier to view funny pictures, media sharing is more efficient and less time-consuming via a mobile phone.
