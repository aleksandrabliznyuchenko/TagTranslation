Nowadays people are keen on different hobbies which they spend on a lot of time. One of the most popular interest is watching sports. That is why one group of people considers that this kind of hobbys is not useful and valuable. I do not share this opinion and belive that watching sports is a good way of relaxing in leasure time. First of all, sport unites and gathers together fans and involves in a game. It does not play a role a status of people, their other interests and hobbies or values in the life (political or religious). Moreover, you can find a good friend or wife/husbend at the stadium or in the bar where the match is held. Also people can celebrate the winning after event and go somewhere together. So, watching sports developes strong comminications.
The second reason is a promoring healthy lifestyle. People who watch sports programms or attend sports events more often think about physical form and how to be more fit. It is also spreaded to people who are around of the sports fan, for example, in the famile. It appears one more common hobby for all members. Thus, in general more people are taking care about health and doing exercises.
In coclusion, watching sport is not waste of time and has mostly positice impact. I guess it is a perfect hobby and spending leasure time with friends or famile. Sports helps to be closer with others people and encourage to keep healthy way of living.
