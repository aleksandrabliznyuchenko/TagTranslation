Nowadays the amount of different types of sport increases, as well as various sport events which can be watched on TV or either by your own eyes. However, some people think that spending time watching other people playing sports is not productive enough and does not have benefits. I disagree with this point of view, since I think that watching sports games can benefit our society a lot.
First of all, with the spread of different sport chanels, TV shows or events, the demand for sport drastically increases. That is, the more people watch sports, the more they have an incentive to do sports themselves and share this desire to their family and friends. This overall increases the level of health in the soceity, since more people are doing sports and it is becoming a certain trend. Secondly, sports can help people to get rid of their adrenaline. In fact, some fans can be really agressive while supporting their favourite teams, so it is better that their are wasting it during the sport events, rather than bringing it inside their families.
However, some people tend to say that time that has been wasted on watching sports can have been spent in another more productive way. More than that, some over-enthusiastic people can lose a lot of money while putting all of their money hoping that their favourite team will win. Nevertheless, watching sports can help people which do not have physical ability to do sports or do not have enough money. Sports events can help them at least to feel all the variety of emotions that sports can bring.
All in all, both opinions have strong support, but I think that spending time watching sports games has more positive sides than negative. It can promote the healthy style of life in the society, help people to get rid of their stress and allow people with disabilities to fulfill their dreams.
