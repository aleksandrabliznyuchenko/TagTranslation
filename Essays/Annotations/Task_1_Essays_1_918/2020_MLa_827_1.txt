The charts below illustrate the changes in the number of peoople using Facebook within a period of 2012 and 2013 and the main reasons for using this social network.
As can be seen from the first graph, the number of people who use Facebook with the help of desktop decreased nearly threefold during a year (from150 million of users to 58 million of users). In comperison with the previous year, in 2013 there is a tendency of using Facebook via mobiles rather than via desktop.
The main trend that may be observed is that women tend to use Facebook in order to share photos and videos more often than man do (54% and 39% relatively). The downward trend in using desktops might have influenced the increasing popularity of sharing photos and videos as mobiles provide better opportunities for doing it. Moreover, the number men and women receiving updates using Facebook is the same and consistutes 39%. Women who made up 43% see funny photos via this social network, while men who do so account for 35%.
Overall, the trend of mobiles gaining popularity comparing with desktop is shown in the first graph, and these devices allow men and women to extend their activities, which vary in Facebook.
