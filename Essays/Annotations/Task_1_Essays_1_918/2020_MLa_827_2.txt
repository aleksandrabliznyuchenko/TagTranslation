Many people claim that watching sport cannot supersede the process of participation in it, while others disagree with them. In this essay I am going to provide my own opinion on this topic and support it with pursuasive arguements.
Sport is considered by the majority of us as being a part of a team that plays certain game or doing special activities alone. Nonetheless, there is a clast of sport-lovers who prefer watching it on TV or visiting sport events to participating in it. First of all, watching sport is a brilliant alternative to actually playing it. If a person has serious health problems or he or she cannot enjoy playing football or hockey, getting pleasure from the process of the game is available for everybody who has TV or the Internet. It may bring a person the same amount of excitement and tension as he or she running a marathon with the professional runners.
Secondly, watching sports trains your logical thinking. The experts have done the research on the impact that watching games has on us. They have come to the conclusion that when a person follows the process of the game, for example, he or she thinks about strategy and tries to predict the possible outcome. It helps to develop critical thinking and makes us more attentive and concentrated. What is more, watching sports enables people to feel a belonging to something meaningful. It empowers us and makes us feel happy. Watching sports together can also make you feel united and supportive. This process is a good way to relieve stress and spend some time with people you love.
All in all, I believe that watching sports is useful in many aspects. This type of spending free time provides people with positive emotions, enables them to experience team spirit and develops strategical thinking.
