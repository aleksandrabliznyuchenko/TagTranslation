Today more people start to think that watching sports is a useless activity. However, sports fans strongly disagree with this statement. I personally believe that sports broadcasting is not as useless as it may seem.
Firstly, sports TV broadcasting can encourage young people to participate in some kinds of sport themselves. This will have a better impact on their health and fit. There are a lot of stories of great athletes that were watching the Olympics or other tournaments and decided that they want to be on such a championship. Such encouragement to do sports is very valuable in our days, when more and more children are suffreing from obesity or diabetes.
Secondly, watching sports is similar to watching a film or a tv-series. It helps people to forget about their own problems and to switch to something less stressful for them. This not only improves their mental health but also can make them happier.
However there are some people who disagree with this point of view. In their view, watching sports not only distracts people from a more important things to do, but also can make them more aggressive. For example some football fans can fight with the fans of the opposite team. And this can lead to serious consequences.
I respect their opinion, but cannot agree with it. Football "hooligans" and other people who are aggressively support their team or athletes are only a small number. These people will still be aggressive even without sports.
In conclusion, i would like to say that watching sports may not be the best activity, but not as useless as some people think. People need to have faith in something even if it is a faith that their favourite team will win the championship.
