Watching sports is very popular and widespread hobby all around the world. While some people really enjoy it and spend a lot of time doing it, others believe that this activity is completely meaningless and worthless. I agree with the second opinion and think that watching sports is not very productive, entertaining and healthy way to spend some free time and in this essay I describe why I think so.
Firstly, watching sport games and competitions is very bad for spectators physical health. This activity means sitting in one position for a long span of time which can lead to health problems if you do it regullary. Therefore, watching sport is much less healthy than a lot of any other hobbies. Also, a lot of people tend to eat junk food and drink alcohol while watching football games, hockey plays and other kinds of sports. This behavior might lead to even bigger amount of health problems.
Secondly, watching sports might be harmful for person's mental health. It can evolve such negatives emotions as sadness, dissapointment or anger. For instance, it is a very common for different teams supporters to fight during or after some game, but this violence can be prevented. Whilst regular experience of such feeling as sadness combined with harmful behaviour like drinking which was described above can lead to development of alcocholism.
To sum up, I am convinced that watching sports is not a good way to spend free time because it involves behaviour that is harmful both for person's physical and mental health.
