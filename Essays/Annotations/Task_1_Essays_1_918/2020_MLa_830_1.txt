There are two charts showing the use and reasons for using Facebook. In the first one we can see how users changed thair device for using Facebook. The amount of desctop users decreesed from 150 million to almost a 140 million. While mobile users rised from less then 60 to almost 100 users. All this changes happend in only one year.
I can tell that there is a trand of growing popularity of mobile use of Facebook app. While emount of desktop users is declining. This may be because of rapid development of smartphones and convenient Facebook app for them.
Second chart shows 4 main reasons for using Facebook and how many men and women named thoes reasons. Starting from "Sharing photos / videos" we can see that less men use Facebook for that particular reason then women. Women - 54% while men are 39%. But equil emount of men and women use Facebook for receiving updates. Next reason again shows us difference in users. 43% of women uses Facebook to see funny posts, but 8% less men think this is tone of main resons. And last and the least reason is "Learning about ways to help others". Only 35% of female users and even10% less male users users see it as a main reason to use Facebook.
This shows that more women use Facebook for entertainment content then men. But also more women tand to help others with help of Facebook posts.
