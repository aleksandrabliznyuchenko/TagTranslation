The charts below show the differences between facebook user experience of men and women and how devices which were used to access facebook changed over one year.
In March 2012 about 150 million users accessed facebook via desktop but after a year this number decreased slightly. However, the change between mobile users was more significant. We can see a sharp increase from 55 million of users to almost a 100 million.
The second graph shows difference between male and female user experience. We can see that equal part of both sexes use facebook for getting new information. However unlike women, men rarely share photos or video because only 39% performs such actions in facebook, which is 15% less in comparison with female respondents. Such patterns can be viewed in other research questions. On both questions amount of male respondents, who use facebook for posts reading or learning about ways to help others is lower on 8 percent in average.
To conclude, these 2 graphs show how user cases can differ from not only year to year, but in terms of gender too.
