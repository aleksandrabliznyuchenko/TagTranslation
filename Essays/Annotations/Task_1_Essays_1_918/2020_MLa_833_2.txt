Watching sport competitions is an entertainment with a long history. Even in ancient times people gathered in the stone round stadium to see young athlets run, jump, or fight with each other. Despite of this charming glimpse of the past, one may consider watching sports worthless. And indeed, spectators spend their time, money, and attetion, but they can never get even a slightest piece of the skill, shape, and glory, which gain the hockey or football players in their turn. Maybe it is beter to do sports istead of visitng sport events.
Firstly, modern stadiums are no longer made of bare stone, but they are still the places of great energy and excitment. Only a true sport fan knows how upbeating a simple match can be. If favourite team loses, then he or she will be waiting for the next game, but if the team wins, the rest of the day or, perhaps, the rest of the week will be filled wth joy and perfect mood. In iother words, watching sport can be a very efficient way to cheer yourself up.
Secondly, watching sports and doing sports are actually closely interconected. When I was in the middle school, it was extremly interesting for me to stare at TV, enjoying how Sharapova hits that small yellow ball with all her strengths. It inspired me to work out my arm so I could hit as strong as Sharapova did. TV match can teach a young player a lot of things: how to hit, how to move, which strategy to use. So I can hardly imagine professional sports without TV translations.
To sum up, watching sports is not only interesting, but also helpful in many ways. One does not necessarily should do sports instead of watching to grasp all its beauty.
