There is no unanimity on the isuue of watching sports. Some people reckon that watching sports, not depending on whether it a live event or on TV, is wasting of time. I do support this point of view since watching sports gas more drawbacks than advantages.
To begin with, watching sport events provokes an increase in stress and aggression levels. In 2015, the Stanford University conducted a survey that proved that after watching sport events people, espessially men, tend to become more emotional. For example, they are becoming more rude even when they talk to their relatives. Scientiscts consider that this notion is linked to the increased level of some hormones that affect the brain. Moreover, when people watch life sport events, and there are two different teams, fans may start to fight each other in ordet to protect their teams. Such fights usually lead to severe consequences, for example, death tolls. As a result, watching sport event has dire consequences in both situation either a person watches TV or live spotr event.
Furthermore, there are much many leasure activities that a person can be engaged in without harm to family mambers or other people. For example, there is a bruch of fitness centers that allow to keep a good shape and be healthy. Also, a sport-lover may spend more tome with the family by doing some activities together, for instance, reading books and watchind educational videos. Some scientists consider that if a person spends spare time with a family or by doing some exersises; the time is not wasted because there will be a lot of positive side effects in the future.
On balance, taking into account arguments listed above, it is possible to assume that watching sports may be considered as a waste of time since there are a number of disadvantages of it and many more other activities that worth spending time on.
