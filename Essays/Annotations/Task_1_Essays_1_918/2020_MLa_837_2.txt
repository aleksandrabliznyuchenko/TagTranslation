Whereas opinions are divided as to spending time on watching sports is a useless way to spend your time or not, I believe that watching some sport activities or events not only a joyful thing, but sometimes can be quite useful and beneficial.
Firstly, watching sports is beneficial for your overall mental health. According to the recent research of Institute of Massachusetts, people who like watching sports and do it on a weekly basis tend to be more calm, happier and mentally healthier than who doesn't. Apparently, it can be explained by the fact that while watching sport games or other activities, people release their temper, anger and negative emotions. Moreover, the feeling when your favourite sportsmen or a national team win brings you happiness and joy.
Secondly, looking after other people doing sports can help to develop cognitive skills, improve strategical thinking or to avoid some mistakes, which can be done by other players. As was pointed out recently by John Brown, the head of the Global Association of couches, there's a common practice of rewatching your own games in recording and watching games of other teams among professional sportsmen. Watching and analyzising other players can be compared to the practice when states look what their neighbour-states have done and try not to do like the same because the outcome wasn't so positive as was expected. What's more, practically, all of us, while watching sport games, tend to try to predict what player is going to do. That behaviour helps to improve strategical thinking.
To conclude, as I have said previously, watching sports isn't pointless at all due to the fact that it helps improve mental stability and develop cognitive skills and strategical thinking.
