Today many people became sport fans: some of them prefer to participate in sport events themselves, while others tend to watch the matches from their sits. However, without entering "the game" a man is considered wasting his time. The essay will overview the possible cons of being " sport watcher".
First off all, the way how you perform is largely depends on your own capacity. Many people today have no possibilities to get involved in some spots physically. That is mainly due to free-time luck: tones of working hours make us feel worse in the evening, unable to do any other activities instead of eating dinner and getting relax from watching any sport event (in case you are a fan). In this way, such entertainment as watching sports lets tired workers remove the stress, feel engaged in a "play" and discuss it with colleagues the next day during the coffee break.
Moreover, some people may watch different sports in order to look for some new strategies while playing by their own. During the game, one's can not see all the weak points of their play performance, but taking glance at other sportsmen efforts and mistakes can provide a fan with certain understanding of how he should behave during his next gaming.
To conclude, the way a fan participate in any sports is different from what person he is, how much time can he spend on being involved in physical activities. When people get some knowledge or feeling of relax from watching the event, promise, it can not be called "useless" or even "a waste of time".
