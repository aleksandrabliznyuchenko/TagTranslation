Many people belive that spending your time of watching tv sport translations is just a waste of time. I persanaly do not agree about it.
First of all I have to say that do not like watching sports but still a belive that it might be interesting for others. Frist, the main benefit from watching sports, it is a great way to learn rules of your favorite game, whcih is very halpful fro kids who are getting ready to start doing sport.
Second, watching sport is a great way of relaxing or an opposite: beeing exited, especially for those who used to play sport but do not have such an option in a current time. For example my grand father spent hiw whole life on playing sport, but now when bicouse of his age, he cannot do this. Watching sport is the best way for his to get involved in these events again.
Ofcourse somebody might say, that instaed of watching sports you should go outside and play it, but as I alredy said, not everyone have such an option. Somebody has issues whith health. Sometimes people just like watching sport but hate doing it, it aslo happens, but if watching sport gives them positive emotions, than why the should not watch it?
In the end I would like to say, that everyone has different hobbies and interests, but it does not mean that if you do not like something it should be boring for everyone. And if your hobbie makes you happy, it can not be a waste of time.
