From ancient times watching sport games is a rather popular hobby especially among men. People like watch them because supporting a favourite team, wathcer can feel practically the same range of feelings as a sportsman, for example, adrenaline, worrying and even the same disappointment if the game is lost. Nevertheless, as for me I think that watching sport games is a waste of time and now I am going to outline my arguments to this question.
First of all, there are a lot of ardent fans who are not going to miss any of the matches of favourite group, even if the match is held in other country, so in such way it can lead to dire consequences. For example, I think that no one employer is ready to leave an employee every time when he wants to visit a match, so often such people just fire and in such way there re life is collapsed. Secondly, watching sport can also lead to psychological problems, depression. I know a lot of people who every time when their favourite team loses the game, they get depression, do not go outside for several days. Addition to this, they can also feel aggression which can lead to domestic violence. Thirdly, because matches usually last very long, physical healt also deteriorate, here we can talk about eye problems and even obesity. For example, a lot of people prefer eat chips, gamburgers wathcing the match.
In conclusion, I can say that everyone himself decides wheter he should or not watch matches, it can become an addiction and collapse our life.
