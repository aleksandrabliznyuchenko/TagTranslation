Many people consider that watching sport games on TV has no benefit. I fully disagree with this statement. Every person has its own situation, different from other people and for some of them watching sports brings a great benefit.
First, for many people to watch the game of their favourite team is to have some relax after long and hard day at their work. People come back home and just want to lie on the sofa and to watch the TV. In my opinion, watching sport games have brings benifit for people, instead of watching stupid TV shows. For example, football can develop people's attention, can train their brain and to remain their focus.
Second, in the world there are many people that can not do their favourite sports. For example, disabled people. These people have no opportunity to do sports. They become happy just watching it. Often these people go to the stadiums to cheer for their favourite team. It is the only possibility for them to be the part of the game.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasize, that watching sport games and events is always not a waste of time. Every person has its own opinion regarding watching games, but different people have different situations in life. That is why, for some of them it could be the only chance to participate in sport life.
