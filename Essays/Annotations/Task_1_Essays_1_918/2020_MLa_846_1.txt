My task is two summarise given information and mark the main features in these tables.
To begin with, the most noticeable thing is the difference between the way people check their Facebook account. In March 2012, the number of users, who check their account with the help of the desktop was around 150 millions. However, in 2013 it decrease to 130 million of users. At the same time, the part of the graph, which is connected with mobile usage, increased a lot;it moves from 50 millions to 90 millions of users.
Going to the next graph, I would like to point out that women use Facebook more for some entertainment stuff such as: sharing photos and videos (54%), seeing funny photos (43%). Men have only 39% and 35% of interest in these groups. The most popular reason of using Facebook among men is the receiving updates (39%). Women have the same 'reason' percentage for this. However, it is one of the least important things for female part on Facebook.
That is all I wanted to say.
