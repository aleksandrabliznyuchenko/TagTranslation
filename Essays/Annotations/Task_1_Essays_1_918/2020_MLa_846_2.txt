Some people have an opinion that watching sports, without doing them, is a waste of time. However, I can't agree with this statement.
For one thing, watching sports can reduce the amount of stress. It is common knowledge that each person has his/her own way to cope with stress. Someone can wash dishes, someone needs food for calming. So, sports can be also the way to forget about your problems. Sometimes I do that too. Moreover, live sports events can be the part of your training system. For example, there is a tennis player - Svetlana Kuznetsova. She said in one of the interview for "Sports24" that live tournaments improved her tennis skills a lot. Svetlana took some special elements from different sportsmen and combine it in her unique technique.
For another thing, government invest tons of money for developing sports. Successful sportsmens increase the status of the state. However, not every sportsmen in the sport because of the will of their parents. Some of them decided to be a part of this sports world only because of the TV programs or live sports events. Just try to remember the feeling after you watch some skiing competition. All the sportsmen are so beautiful and graceful. So, maybe not now, but in a few years after watching all this stuff, you would like to become a sportsmen.
At the end, summarizing all above mentioned, I would like to say that even watching sports can be useful. We cannot deny the fact that it is spiritually-improving. That is why I personally disagree with the point of view, which was mentioned in the very begging of the essay.
