The charts illustrate how Facebook usage changed throughout the period from 2012 to 2013 and outline the main reasons men and women browse Facebook for.
The first graph shows that during the designated period the majority of people browsed Facebook using their laptops. In March 2012 the figure amounted to approximately 150 million people, and in March 2013 it constituted roughly 139 million people. As can be seen, towards the end of the period the number of desktop Facebook users slightly decreased. The reverse is true for mobile users. It increased by about 40 million people.
The second graph depicts the main reasons for which males and females use Facebook. As is evidenced from the chart sharing photos and videos is the top reason women use the media. As far as men are concerned, sharing images make up the same percentage as receiving updates on the topics males are interested in. As for women, seeing funny images comes in the second place and learning about ways to help others is the least popular reason for using Facebook. Males largely replicate this scheme.
Overall, it is clear from the charts that the general trend for Facebook usage is falling.
