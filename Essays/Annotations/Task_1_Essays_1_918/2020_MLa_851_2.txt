According to some people, spending time by watching sports is just killing precious time. However, I cannot agree with this opinion. As for me, it is a useful activity.
To begin with, by watching sports in leisure time, a person can learn many useful things, for example, team spirit. Also, while watching, we can gain immense knowledge about the game. Moreover, watching sports with our friends is a great opportunity to spend some time together. More than that, cheering together for our favourite team brings us closer.
Sports lovers often have role models that fascinate them the most. One gets inspired and choose sports as their career, others tries to copy them and follow their advice to stay fit. For example, many boys want to become a footballer in oder to be like Ronaldo.
In conclusion, I want to stress that watching sports in leisure time is a good way of spending time and for some people this hobby can turn into a career and change their lives. I also think that parents should encourage their children to develop interest in sport by watching it and participating in it.
