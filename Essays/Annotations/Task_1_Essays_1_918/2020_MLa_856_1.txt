The graphs show the variation in the number of users of Facebook among man and women and their reasons for using current social network interests.
On the bar chart bar showing the use of Facebook we can see that between March 2012 and March 2013 there was a slight decrease in the amount of desktop users. The user count fell from approximately 150 millions to about 140 millions users. On the other hand, in the same timeframe we can see a rather sharp increase in the amount of people using Facebook on mobile. It skyrocketed from about 60 millions users to approximately 100 million users.
Now let's examine the graph showing the various reasons for why men and women use Facebook. The exact same percentage of men and women use Facebook for receiving updates at 39%. In other categories, however, women have a lead. A higher percentage of women use Facebook in order to share photos and videos, see funny post and learn about ways to help others.
In result, we can notice that women are more often users of Facebook than a man, it can be seen from graphs and analyses.
