The bar chart illustrates changes in the number of people using a computer of a mobile phone for checking thier Facebook accounts during the year. It is clear that there is a trend to use less desktops (the difference became about 15 millions of people) and more mobile phones. The proportion of those who prefer using them raised from about 55 millions to about 95 through the year from March 2012 to March 2013. That lets us talking about a raising tendency in using smartphones for checking FAcebook.
On the second graph we can see a comparison of the key points about using Facebook by different people. The most attracting thing is that the main part of them are women, who prefer sharing photos and videos rather then learning about some ways to help others. Oppositely, men like both sharing and receiving updates in Facebook, but also are not keen on learning about something connected with volunteering and helping others.
