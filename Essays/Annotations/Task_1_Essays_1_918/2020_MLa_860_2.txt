Nowadays spending time stalking some sport events is not rarely. However, there are lots of people who are not keen on watching some sports and have bad relationships with those who are not agree with them. In my opinion, a simple sitting on the sofa and watching TV is not really useful timespending.
Looking at the screen showing something connected with sport would not bring any useful things to bodies and brains of watchers. In this case it would be better to do some sport themselves. This change will let them become healthier and stronger that causes and developing of the brain. Also having a good physical shape, being fit is a way to taking part in some sport events themselves as a sportsman.
On the other hand, there is an opinion that not all people are supposed to become a professional sportsman. For example, they may have some health problems which would not let them it. But if some people have such a problem, they have an opportunity to look through a vide range of kinds of sport that allows everybody to find their own variant from swimming to chess. A disable does not mean that you can only watch the championships and nothing else.
Another point is the connection between being a fan of the sport recordings and influencing of sport to the sportsmen's health. Watching some sport events we support continuing of long and exhausting of them which sometimes causes illnesses and traumas as and championships or Olympic games.
Summarising up, I am concerned that simple watching something connected with sport and championships is not a great idea of timespending because of unproductivity of it and supporting in some way harmful professional sport. Instead of this doing some sort yourself is much better and healthier.
