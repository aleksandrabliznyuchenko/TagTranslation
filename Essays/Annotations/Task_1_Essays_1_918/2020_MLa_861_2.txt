Nowadays sport events have became an essential part of our life as a great way to maintain the health, and as the type of leisure activity, too. Many people enjoy watching competitions and sport games. There is a diversity of television programmes which suggest people to watch these kinds of events without living home. Some persons claim that spending time this way is a kind of the time-wasting actions. I firmly disagree with this opinion. This essay will outline the arguments to prove that watching sport has advantages and cannot be considered a waste of time. The first point to consider is the aesthetics of human body, the movements, which can become a source of inspiration for many people who even do not practice any kind of sport activity. For example, figure skating is considered one of the most beautiful sports, it is also called a kind of art which combine the artistic expression of the skaters, the music, the bright-coloured sophisticated costumes, ect. Furthermore, there are many painters which depict the sportsmen in their pieces of art. If watching sports was a waste of time, would this subject be popular in the field of visual arts?
The second important quality of sport event is the psychological aspect. People engaged in sport activities can be characterised as very resilient persons, self-confident. They are strong not only physically, but mentally, too. Watching sport events, especially competitions, can set an example for children. Furthermore, it can be a reason for a child to start doing sports which is essential for his or her health. Sport can prevent the risk of obesity of children which became an urgent problem of modern society.
To summarise, watching sport games is an activity full of advantages, such as aesthetic inspiration and motivation for children.
