The bar charts demonstrate the usage of the most popular social network called Facebook from 2012 to 2013 and the several arguments why it's so popular now. It is clear from the first glance on the chart that the usage of the mobile phones to enter the facebook increased, while usage of desktops became less actual in the March of 2013.
In all, women use Facebook much more than men, especially in the aspect of the sharing photos & videos, but percent of the receiving updates is similar for all of two genders - 39%. In addition, like we can see from the chart, women see funny posts more likely than men. The next category is about learning about ways to help others and there women win again - the female percentage is 35% and the male one is 10% less than the previous one - the 25%.
To sum up, the usage of the Facebook is increasing gradually and in the most cases it used by women.
