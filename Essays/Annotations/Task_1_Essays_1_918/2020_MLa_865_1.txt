Since 2012 to 2013 the amount of Facebook users has grown up and there are some interesting details in comparing men and women type of using. First of all, it is obvious that women are using the social network in bigger amount of time than men. The second diagram shows us that women more likely to share their photos or videos, see funny posts and learn about ways to help others than men. But in receiving updates we see the same amount of users of both genders which is 39% for both. Also the interesting dynamic is shown at the first chart: the number of mobile version users has grown up through the year almost two times. If in 2012 the amount of desktop users was three times bigger than mobile then in 2013 the mobile users became more than a half from amount of desktop users.
