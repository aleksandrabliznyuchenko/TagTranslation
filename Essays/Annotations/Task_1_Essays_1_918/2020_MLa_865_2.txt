There are a lot of sports fans all over the world and also there are some people who don't like it the same way and even think that being a viewer is a waste of time. I personally believe that watching sports is a great experience and here are some reasons why.
First of all, you get the opportunity to became the part of some fascinating and very important event. You can feel the atmosphere of holiday and the unity with all the people around. Especially, if you are lucky to get to the live match, the memories after seeing the game in person will be unforgettable.
The second important reason is that you are able to support your favorite team. Sportsmen often say that even if they don't know their audience in person their cheering from the tribunes is still very important. I believe that the energy of the fans may lift up the playing team's spirit and help them win the game.
The third argument is that football or volleyball or whatever kind of sports match is one of the best way to spend time with your closest people (for example, family or friends) at home. The process collect you together and give a lot of positive emotions. Even if some of you doesn't know the rules of the game or doesn't have the favorite team he or she still can learn something new from this way of time-spending.
To sum up, I think that sport is always a great idea either it will be just watching a game on TV or from the live stadium. It helps you to understand some different of your daily activities sphere of life better and gives the sense of unity with people of all kinds no matter how close you are to each other.
