The diagrams present the use of Facebook in different ways by men and women over the span of the year. It can be noticed that the popularity of Facebook has decreased overall among both genders. Moreover, by the March of 2013 people started to prefer mobile app to computer version of the social media. Overall, women seem more active in communication on Facebook, as data about men shows that they are equal to females only in terms of receiving updates. The most favoured activity by far is sharing photos and videos, followed by reading memes, whereas the least is finding ways to help others. It is interesting to notice that even on social platforms women are naturally more keen on supporting others. Consequently, it can be said that on average people access Facebook to share the happenings of their lives and learn what their friends did or are willing to do. Thus, Facebook becomes more like an addition to life, not its continuation. To summarise, women are overcoming men in terms of social media use, but generally its popularity is declining.
