The topic of the watching sports is often to discuss, as there are many of sport fans having this tradition. However there are those who believe that watching sport events is a simple waste of time. And this essay supports the latter point of view.
The first point to consider is that the sports-watchers only image that they participate in the event as they do not affect on the result. What is more, in my point of view, they could not to watch the translations online nor to go to the life spots events, spending hours and hours to watch, but fans simply may find the results of the event after that in the internet. As the example, my father do this way when he is not able to watch the sports and, personally, I do not understand the difference.
Another issue that needs to be dealt with is the form of some stadiums which is imperfects to watch the life events, because in some cases watchers cannot even see what is going on. So often they cannot participate even by looking.
However, looking this issue from the position of sport-amateurs, it is their right to choose the way to relax. As, speaking generally, all the distractive activities can be considered as 'waste of time' as it is fact: people produce nothing while reposing. Some people go to theater or to the musical life-concerts some - on sport events. And for the sport-watchers is more important the feeling of the participation in the event, than the result.
To conclude, I do not understand the love to the sports watching and I believe it as a simple wasting of time as the watcher do not affect on result and not always can even see what it is going on during the life events, however all the distractive activities can be considered as the waste of time so it is a question of point of view.
