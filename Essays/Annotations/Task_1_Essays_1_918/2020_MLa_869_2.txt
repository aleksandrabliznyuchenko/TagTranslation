Watching sports on TV and at live events is a common hobby of many people. Soccer fans spend their money on ticket to a live event, which they cannot afford, some people can get depression or become very happy because of their favourite basketball club failure or winnig. Another half of society does not understand that passion to sports and thinks about it as a waste of time. There is a reason to think badly about watching sports. Sitting the whole evening near TV on a weekend is the worst way spend free from work or studiyng time. It is much healthier to do sports, than to watch them - playing soccer any sport provides blood to the brain and helps to sleep better. Sitting near TV is worse, at that point, than watching sports at live events, because there it is possible to breath fresh air, which will be good for health.
Talking about good side of watching sports, it is clear that looking after professional sportsmen it is easier to learn how to play any game. Remembering the movements, the reactions, the lifehacks which sportsmen show and talk about is very helpful for children and for adults as well. From this point of view watching sports online or at live event is definately not a waste of time, it is more a studiyng proccess.
From the first sight watching sports may seem a useless hobby which only wastes free time, but on the other side it is helpful for those, who want to upgrade their sportive skills. In my opinion, watching sports is interesting and motivating to becoming better in sports. I hope that in the future more teenagers will not be afraid to try sports after watching it on TV.
