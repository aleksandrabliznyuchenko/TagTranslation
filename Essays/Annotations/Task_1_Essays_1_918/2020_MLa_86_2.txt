Nowdays the subject of sport is said to be one of the most crucial in the terms of quarantine and isolation. The same as before, many people have an essential need in watching their favourite events in sport via TV or in real life. On the other hand, watching sports instead of doing something more useful is found to be a pure waste of time. Personnaly, I'm not really keen on sport at the moment. In my younger days we used to gather all the family members together in one room in front of the TV and watch the football match of the team we were all supporting. Inevitably, when you grow up the lack of time resourse problem becomes crutial and you have to choose what should you spend it on.
It would definetely be a mistake of mine if I call watching sports a 'waste' of time, because considering the others opinion is obviously not less important. In my case there simply are different time-spending priorities, such as work, studying, rest etc. Watching sports could surely be identified as a type of 'rest', however it works individually and is not my peace of cake, to be honest. As the most genuine example, I would prefer sleeping or watching a calm film to have the real rest from the everyday life boiling with emotions and actions than have another portion of adrenaline from a sport event.
In conclusion, there is no clear view on the topic globally, because of the amount of opinions and people who find watching sports a distraction or a way to have some rest with colleagues and friends can't be judjed. As for me, watching a sport event can't be comparised with the other things I find useful to spend time on, that is why I don't watch sports at all.
