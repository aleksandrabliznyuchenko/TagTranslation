There is no denying that physical activities have become extremely popular in recent decades. Sportive programms are widely translated on TV and hugely visited by fans in person. However, the majority of people started to voice their concerns about the neccessity and usefulness of joining to watch sportive TV programms or even to attend to matchs. As for me, I am strongly convinced that watching sports is a dull leisure time. First and foremost, it is common that people who appeal to watch sports does not support their physical condition and do not participate in any sports hence receiving no profit except of enjoying the process of watching and being the part of a fun community. Some may argue that the above mentioned sequence makes watching sports beneficial for people. However, I strongly believe that physical activites should be and have to support humans in a perfect physical condition not to serve as an entertaining object for watching on TV or at live sports events.
The second point to consider is advantages of such time-spending for brain activity. The greatest drawback of watchinging but not participating in physical activities is that it does not make people neither stronger nor cleverer. Nevertheless, it is impossible to persuade me that any leisure should provide people with new information and knowledge therefore broading their horizons and making them more educated.
The supporters of an opposing opinion claim that watching sports strengthens people's bonds and interactions, unifying humans of different nations who share the same interests. However reasonable this position is, I stil deem that people should place their intelecctual development at the first place highlighting it as a prioraty.
To conclude, it is obviuos for me that any leisure activity should be useful for people supporting them in due physical or mental form. Even though watching sports help people to tie their relationships, it apparently does not make them fitter or more intelligent.
