For a lot of years watching sport games was a hobby. There are a lot of big fans around the world and there only desire to look at their favourite player or team winning the competition. But there are some people who thinks that it is a waste of time. I think that each hobby has rights to "live".
A lot of people all over the world are big football fans, for example. And they are different people. Some of them are lasy persons, some are the most famous millioners. Hobby is not connected to that. They have fun, during the match, but they have a lot of things to do. For example, my grandfather is a great football fan, but this is his time for relaxation. When there are no matches he has his work, plans and so on. So watching sports is just one type of activities that you can chose during free time. So i think that it is normal to spend your time on things in which you are interested and it is not the waste of time. However there are some people who are strongly against watching sports. They ususally explain their position with the help of the phrase: 'it is much more healthier and cleverer to go and play yourself instead of watching how another people work wnen you are lieing on the bed'. This position is understendable because for example according to the internet research you get a greater ammount of dofamine when you are playing by yourself.
To conclude, there are a lot of people with different vission and each point of view has its own right. But i think that in 2020 you can not say to people what is right or wrong for them. Thats why i personally disagree with the statement "watching sports is a waste of time".
