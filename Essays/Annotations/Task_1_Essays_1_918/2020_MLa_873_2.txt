Nowadays TV presents a wide range of different programmes for individuals. Many people enjoy watching sports events, however, some people consider this activity completely wasteful and goofy. I strongly disagree with the second opinion and I am going to illustrate my point of view in the following essay.
To begin, watching sports unites people all over the world. The Olympic games are being shown in every country every two years. Rooting for your country and your national team, in my opinion, does not interfere with an ability to see the power of humanity and passion, which overwhelms watchers. This is the reason, why watching sports is a great hobby.
Secondly, we should not forget people that love sport, but do not have time or financial support to buy flight tickets or sports tickets, which in our times are quite expensive. Hence, for some people the only way to see their favourite sportsman or sportswoman can be approached by turning on the TV only. Furthermore, the competitive atmosphere and the will to be like their role model encourages people to do sport. Besides, the quality of streaming with a commentator is sometimes preferable.
To conclude, as I have shown, watching sports helps people feel united universally. Moreover, sport affects peoples lives by showing that human limits can be pushed. In my opinion, the assertive role of sport is evident and I am against people who claim watching sports useful.
