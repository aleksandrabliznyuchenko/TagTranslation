The diagrams given represent the preferred means of media used for Facebook in the period from 2012 to 2013 and the intentions behind the usage of this social network among man and women.
In March 2012 there were 200 million people using Facebook, and 75 per cent of them were connecting to the website via desktops. But by March 2013, as the total amount of users grew, about 40 per cent of users preferred using the mobile version of the network.
When asked about their personal reasons for using Facebook, about a half of women name the ability of sharing visual media and seeing funny posts. Men are less interested in these features than women, yet both genders admit the importance of receiving updates via the social network. When it comes to searching the information on how to help others, only a quarter of men involved in the research said that this ability is important to them, whereas this feature was relevant for more than a third of women.
