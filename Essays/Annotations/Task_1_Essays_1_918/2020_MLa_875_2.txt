The popularity of watching sports games has increased in the recent decades. The question whether this activity is a waste of time or not has become a widely discussed topic. From my point of view, watching sports is not meaningless, on which I am going to elaborate further.
To begin with, all sports events require an audience. Whether it is a local basketball game between teenagers or an internation tennis match, the presence of viewers is very crucial for the player. Firstly, it motivates him to play better, on the verge of his abilities. Secondly, the support of other people may help the sportsman feel less nervous during the game or performance.
Moreover, watching other people do sports, even via TV, may become a great motivation for the viewers to introduce some fitness into their lives. It does not just lead to the development of such an idea; sometimes it causes almost a physical urge to move your body, to stretch or run. In addition, by observing the way others play one can learn the rules of the game, the basic techniques, understand some principles and tactics which may come in handy when doing sports by yourself. For example, many professional football players rewatch old games - either famous or their own - in order to prepare for an upcoming event.
To sum up, being a part of a sports game audience is not a waste of time. It is an important social interaction which makes a sports event more interesting and challenging. It can also be a means of motivation to make physical activity a part of your own life and of learning to play or perform correctly.
