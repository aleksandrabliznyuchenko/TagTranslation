In our hectic world people have enormous amount of opportunities to amuse themselves. Some people state that watching sport games is a great way to relax, while others claim that such leasure is a boring waste of resources. As for me, I tend to agree with the latter opinion.
To begin with, sport is an activity to take part in. Many people find it crusially important to keep fit DOING sport, not just sitting on the sofa in a living room watching other people sweating and working hard. Health of the population is a burning issue of nowadays society, so both men and women, young generations and adults should be into various sports as mush as they could. Obviously, watching sport events does not develop one's stamina nor intellectual abilities. Moreover, it is important to note that some sports are very rough and sometimes people become more violent due to the agressive "mood" of shows and games. This factors, of course, also contributes to the children's behaviour as the adults set the example and kids copy it.
However, many people enjoy watching sports - some of them in front of the TV, others attending games in big stadiums. There is no need to proof that there are many ex-players, who are not able to perform now, or couches among fans and this category sees their life in sport. For example, my father used to play basketball professionaly before he got a serious trauma. That is why now he cannot dedicate his time playing himself, but he never misses a single game of his favorite team. I always see how happy and young he feels after watching it.
To sum up, I would like to stress that paying attention on every sports show is an unnecessary thing to do, because as long as we have an opportunity to take part in either individual or team activity we should seize the chance.
