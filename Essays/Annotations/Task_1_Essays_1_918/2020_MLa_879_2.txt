In the modern world where the lack of time affects lives of majority of adult people, the question of leisure of high quallity is being uprising. Some people are spending their free time on self-development reading books, visiting art galleries or watching documentary movies on TV. They are strongly convienced to think that the intellectual activities exceed passive watching of sport matches which, in their oppinion, is nothing but waste of precious time. To the contrast, sport events watching supporters find this kind of time-spending preemptive and appealing due to the emotional storm it could provide. Personally, I do not value TV nor live sport events. First of all, because active mental and physical envolvement in process are crutial for me. Due to the argument, I would rather be a basketball-player myself than would be watching the tournament from the tribune, chair or sport bar. Moreover, I cannot name myself a noisy crowd of people lover, honestly, it deads me well. These are the main arguments to the point why some persons and me personally might find watching sports unatractive. However, there is another point of view on the topic. Some adults completely enjoy watching sport events online and offline. Moreover, they are frequently ready to spend significant sums of money to the aim to see their favorite sport teams having match or challenge in real life. This kind of people justify their lust for sports watching with saying that it provides them geat range of emotions they are not able to gain in daily life. They compare sport events with feasts or festivals and are not ready to imagine their lives without this type of leisureness.
To summarise, there are two contrary point of view on the quastion whether sport events watching is worth it or not. Both of them are should be respected, because in the end everyone runs his time and happieness. However, I would choose another options for time spending than watching sports.
