it is often argued that the process of watching physical activities such as football, swimming or another ones is pointless, neither it is shown in real life or it is a stream. I completely agree with this statement and i think that is a waste of time, which can be spent on a more important business to do.
Firstly, the issue of wasting time for watching sports is very important nowadays because it can take too many hours of a person's life. In average the game lasts about 90 minutes or more, depending of the kind of sport, that is a lot. The football fan can watch a few games in a row, which can lead to a problems in a family, especially if other people don't like that kind of sports. Usually the process of watching is going with a drinking beer or eating junk food, which can lead to a heart disease or obesity, domestic violence. That time could be spent on the family or education, which will give a person a chance to live a better life. Another point to consider is that watching sports can be gambling due to the sports betting, which is very popular in our society. Gambling is a easy way not to win a great amount of money, but to lose it and have nothing after the game. Even witn a small bet that viewer could win there is a small thought that says to the player that he can win more. After that, the viewer is perfectly sure that his favorite team will absolutely win and gamble more money, or even everything that he have to prove his belief in his favorite team. This is the one of the arguments why watching sports is pointless - it can lead to a gambling.
In conclusion, i strongly believe that the problem of wasting time for sports is crucial and can lead to a drinking, gamble problems.
