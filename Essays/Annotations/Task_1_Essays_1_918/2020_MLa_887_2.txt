There are two different points of view about watching sport events on TV or in another places as a stadium. Some people are inclined to believe that it is boring and not so interesting spending of time. I disagree with this suggestion, because watching sport programms or being a spectator of sport event helps people to remember about their health, spend time with friends or family unforgetably.
From one point of view, watching sports is not interesting spending of time. First of all, people may do in that time something really necessary for them. For example, they can cook a dinner for family, communicate with their children, help their old parents or go to shopping in the supermarket. Secondly, watching sports is a type of relaxation and rest and it is not intellectual spending of free time. People may reading a book, listening some podcasts about science, watching something about wildlife, history, politics.
Nevertheless, I disagree with the above opinion. Firstly, sport events with their participants are always a good example of excellent physical forms. It may giving people a chance to remember about their health. Watching sports people will try to keep their fit. Moreover, it is a chance to rest from work and household. A man, who works every day as a full-time white-collar worker, can spend one day in month with his family and friends at the football stadium. Any work can be stressful and boring. and people must have vocations.
To sum up, even though some people may disagree with me, I believe that being a spectator of any sport events is not a waste of time. It is a chance to relax from stressful everyday life and work. Moreover, it helps to keep fit and be healthy.
