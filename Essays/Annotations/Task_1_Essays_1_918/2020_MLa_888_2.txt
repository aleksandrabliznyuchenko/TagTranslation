There is an opinion that watching sport games on TV or visiting different sports events for the same aims are the waste of spare time. As for me, I can understand why some people have such point of view, however I cannot fully agree with this statement.
To begin with, there are plenty significant reasons why people prefer watching the sports games rather than taking part in them. First of all, some people might be disabled or traumatized, so they are not able to play with other people, but they anyway are passionate about being the part of the sports events. In addition, some people spend their time watching sports games because of their relatives, friends or even their favourite sport celebrity taking part in the game. In other word, there are plenty sport funs who just simply want to show their support to the particular player or sport team.
In addition, is sufficient to mention that it is good practice for professional athletes to learn how different teams play or just to find out various new and helpful strategies and useful technics. In other word, watching others playing is extremely good for educational purposes.
The last but not the least, watching games on TV or visiting sports events with friends in real life lead to making connections between different people even citizens of competitive states, for examples, even wars are stopped when the Olympics begin.
In conclusion, I believe that watching sports games can bring only the best in the lives of people taking part in the events, because watching sports games not only makes us more educated, cheerful, but also let people celebrate the victory of the favourite team together.
