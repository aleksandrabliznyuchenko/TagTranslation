Nowadays a lot of people concerned that watching sports (both on television or live) is a useless way of spending time. I am not sure that I can agree with this controversial statement.
First of all, watching sports can inspire and encourage person start doing sports on his own, which is absolutely a positive result. The same thing happened to me when I was a kid: I watched a football match on TV and after the end of a beautiful game I decided to try it myself. I used to go playing football every evening with my friends, moreover, I was able to find new ones by this way of spending free time. It became my hobby.
Another advantage of watching sports is getting new acquaintances, however, it works more with the live watching of games, matches, etc. It is not a secret that sport can unite people. When the football world cup took place in Russia in 2018 there were a lot of people on streets in cities, they were happy and kind. What is more, it is a great opportunity to make friends with residents not only of your own country, but with people from abroad who speak foreign languages. It is also a good way of improving ones communicating and speaking skills.
To conclude, there are much more benefits in watching spots (on TV and especially live) rather then drawbacks. It can help person make new friends, improve his communicating skills or find a favourite hobby which will stay with him forever.
