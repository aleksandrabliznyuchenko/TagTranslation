Nowadays there are many ways of spending time and relaxation and one of them is watching sports. Some people think it is just a useless spending of time. I could not agree with that opinion and in my essay I am going to explain why.
On the one hand, watching sports is the same way of leisure as, for instance, computer gaming or watching soap opera, which allows to forget about problems and to relieve the stress after the hard day's work. At the same time gaming or TV programs much useless and more silly than any kind of sport interaction.
On the other hand, sport is a piece of art, especially if we mean figuring, athletic or horse racing, and in this way it could develop mind and taste much more than something other what people do in their free time. Moreover, many children and adults watching sports home or at live events, seeing the great will of athletes and dancers could think to do sports itself amateur or even professionally in the future. Anyway, to do sport is really useful for health and mind, also the ancient Romans thought: "mens sana in corpore sano".
In conclusion, the positive impact of any involving in sport area is obvious. Namely the sport allows us to not forget in our everyday's hassle that we are humans. So, I am still convinced that watching sports is not a waste of time.
