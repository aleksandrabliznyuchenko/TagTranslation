Some people believe that watching sports it is a wasting time, while others think that it is not. I did not agree with first opinion for few reasons.
Firstly, participating in live sports event rise the level of social activity. A lot of people meeting each other and discussing matches from time to time. Secondly, watching sports helps to enjoy sport activities. A lot of psychologists think that a huge percentage of people start some sport after watching. I truly believe that it is a great chance to expect what you will do and have some preparation before starting sport. Also watching sports helps people to know each other better. Thirdly, I have an example of useful way to watching sports. My uncle had a smoke addiction for 15 years. Once he saw an interesting football match and watch it for the end without time-out for smoking. Than he decided to have an vacation with most incredible matches in history. This situation shows us that watching sports can helps to win the addictions.
To sum it all up, I think that watching sports is totally not a waste of time for a lot of situations. Soccer, basketball, swimming, tennis and other sports are really interesting and helps people to learn more about sports. Also watching sports helps us to have a healthy life without alcohol, cigarettes and drugs. All sportsmen live without this things. I believe that sports start inspire a lot of people to do some sport activities. But there is a group of people who can just unlike watching sports. In may be wives that tired of new football matches or kids because they are small and they are just do not understand what they are watching. But in the end of my speech, I do like to say that every person can find interesting type of sport and watching with pleasure.
