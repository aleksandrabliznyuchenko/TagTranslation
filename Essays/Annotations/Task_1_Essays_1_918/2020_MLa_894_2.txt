Needless to say that sport plays an incredibly importatnt role in our life. Some people prefer do sports and some prefer spend their time watching it. Anyway, there is a group of people who think that they do not like watching sport as it is boring and unneccessary and waste their time. I am going to tell my point of view and give arguments about it.
To begin with, I would like to say that I disagree with the opinion of people who do not like to watch sports and can explainwhy. Firstly, people who watch sport at live sport events together learn to coomunicate and can make new good friends because they have the same interest. There are a lot of examples how fans of some sports get together and help each other outside of the world of sport. Also, people who watch some sport events at home have a lot of fun and know how to spend their free time. For a big number of people all over the world watching sport events at home every weekend is a hobby. Sometimes it can be a hobby even for a whole family which can build good relations between members of the family. By the way, watching sports can be a good hobby for disabled people who cannot take part in sport events. With the help of TV or visiting a stadium they can feel that they are part of this big society and do not feel alone which is good for everyone.
All in all, I have to admit that people will always have arguments about this topic and never come to the same conclusion but I am absolutely sure that watching sports is not a waste of time and have a lot of benefits.
