There are people believing that watching sports events - either on TV or at live - is just a waste of time. On the one hand, they can be understood: it is really much more exciting when a person not just watching but being a part of something, competiting with others, becoming stronger and getting new experience with one's whole body and soul.
But, honestly, I still disagree with this statement.
First of all, watching sports can be considered as a hobby just like writing, drawing, gardering etc. It can not be 'a waste of time' or 'useless' because its primary function is not upgrading level of life-style, education or increasing person's productivity but bringing pleasure and satisfaction to one's soul in his free time. Still, a human can learn a lot from his hobby and change life-style radically: learn new information, change profession, meet new people or even move to another location. For example, a sports fan has an opportunity to visit a lot of places where he can watch live sports events or get accquainted with other fans, take up sports himself and improve his health.
Moreover, not all people have opportunity for participating in sports for many reasons: health condition, location, financial problems (because sometimes sports equipment can be rather expensive) etc. In that case wathcing their favourite sportsmen, tricks and atmosphere as a spectator is the only solution the have. For instance, a little girl dreams about becoming a professional skater: but there is no skate-rink in her town, no trainees and she just has no opportunity for taking up that.
To sum up, different opinions have a right for existance and all of them can be true from some prospective. For some people watching something without participating at it is a nothing, a waste of time; but from my point of view, there is nothing wrong about it until one enjoys his leasure time.
