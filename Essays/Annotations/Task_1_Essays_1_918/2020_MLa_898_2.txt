The argument on the sports events is pretty obvious. Some individuals state that watching sports is useless, while the others say that spectating those events are rather important for some people.
I do not consider spectating sports events as a waste of time. Here some reasons why. To begin with, it is an entertaintment. Watching professional athletes showing the best of their skills is the same to see a good play of an actor or a painting of a famous artist. Competitions of sportsmen make those events even more interesting. Another argument for sports events is the culture built around them. Lots of different sports clubs have huge and loyal fandoms with supporters who really participate in the action by cheering for their favorite competing side. Most of those fandoms were built not in years but in decades of people attending arenas for watsching sports events. Moreover, it should be mentioned that buying tickets for the games and pay-per-view tv broadcasts can financialy support the development of local sport franchises.
Still the sceptics say that there is no good in watching sports. Their most obvious point is that people do not benefit from sitting for about couple of hours watching another people kicking ball of beating each other with kicks and punches. People can use this time for learning and working, creating intellectual or economicaly valuable resourcers for themselves. Even more, those people could spend that time on participating in events like that I fundamentaly disagree with this point. Recent researches say that watching one's favorite sport team or athlete winning match or trophy will help him to recieve more serotonine and dophamine due to associating with supported side. All in all both sides of these argument have some valuable points. But I strongly support people watching sports on TV or at live events in the stadiums and arenas. It can help socialising and improve one's mental health.
