Sports definetely make people more active, healty, and have an enormous impact on their lives, which is usually positive. Hovewer, one of the topics that is usually brought up during the corresponding debates about is that you should play sports instead of watching other people do them. It is a valid point that sounds self-consistent, but I do not agree with it.
First of all, the biggest benefit of watching sports is that it provides a viewer with entertainment. Nowadays the world is a stressful place - politicians fight each other in a seemingly endless debate, global warming threatens the Earth with irreversible effects on climate, and the tensions between all kinds of social groups rise with every moment. In this age of turmoil and constraint, an act of calmly sitting down on a sofa and watching a sports TV show may provide a person with a necessary amount of relaxation and entertainment.
Secondly, the process of watching sports is a great tool for people that are trying to socialize themselves. Sports are among the most popular topics for discussion in all parts of the world. For example, in Russia, during the Football World Cup nearly every human being in this country was talking about the unexpected sucess of our national football team. The championship also attracted a lot of tourist, which lead to a lot of acquaintances among persons of different nationalities from different parts of the globe. Moreover, this event boosted Russia's economy a lot by attracting tourists, that would later spend their money in the local infrastructure.
In conclusion, watching sports is not always a waste of time and this act can be purposeful in many ways. Both individuals and various social groups benefit from it.
