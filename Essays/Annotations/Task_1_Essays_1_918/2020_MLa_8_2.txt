Many man think that following sport invents by TV or in real life is just a foolish way kill the time. I disagree with this topic. I think watching sport events is like watching cinema or theater. People just have a fan. Why them must be blame for this? Some of my friend watch sport channel on TV. They pretty smart and educated. I don't belive than they can useless waste time. But they relax and have good time in party with each others. Some critics can say, that people who only watch sport events lose fit. But it isn't true. I know many people who have came in real sport inspired by sport programs. Many of famous sportsmen say in interviev that thay had favorite in childhood. Willness receive the same result help them make career. Thus TV sport show have main role in produsing new sport stars.
Many people use sport evenst how claim to collect old company togehter again. All we know how in hard may be. Becouse people have different shedule, all have undeclne work and other. But event have certanly time and place thats why your friends can't reorder meeting in other day. It's confortable.
We must consider that sport is kind of art. We can compare sportsmen witn artist. Why not? Both do something that folk love, but haven't some practise value. In this way watching sport show is like meeting art gallery. All of us confirm that it isn't a useless time spending.
To sum up all argument I did't think that wathing TV sport shows is just wasting a time. It funny, sometimes good for insperation do real sport. Also this can help common interest between freinds and other.
