The bar charts depict alterations in Facebook usage from 2012 to 2013 and why men and women opt for using it.
In the first bar chart there might be observed a sufficient decrease of the use of Facebook via desktops from 150 millions of people in March 2012 to 130 millions the year after. In contrary to that, the mobile Facebook market had rapidly developed from 55 to 95 millions of users throughout the given time. Nonetheless, the share of people with desktops outweigh the number of those browsing the site with mobile devices.
The second bar chart shows that the prevailing reason for using Facebook in the whole overlooked period had been sharing photos and videos. among all the genders (54% for females and 39% for males). The least wide-spread among all is learning about ways to help others, ranging from 35 to 25 per cent. The share of women using Facebook for all the purposes is either equal to that of men or slightly bigger with the difference no more than 15 per cent.
The bar charts illustrates that desktop is still broadly used for Facebook, albeit mobile browsing is constantly growing and that females are more active in the use of this social network in comparison with their male counterparts.
