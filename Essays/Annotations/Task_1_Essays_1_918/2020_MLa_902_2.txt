It is believed by some that being a viewer of sport events does not bring use for people. While there are others who think that observing sports is helpful and important. Personally, in this complex issue I woud agree with supporters of visual sport industry.
From the one hand, those, who perceive watching sports as useless, consider that doing actual activity is more beneficial for health and leisure. This argument is strong enough, because the main motivation for doing sports is rasing physical opportunities of bodies. In this perspective, people and especially children can spend time playing outdoors or running than sitting in front of TV or on the stadium. Therefore, observation is deemed as even harmful behavior in current hypodynamic way of life. From the other hand, there is point in simple watching. Sport programs are essential resources of motivation, which inspire people all over the world be in movement. Famous footballers or swimmers let watchers choose and change their attitude to daily routine. Having great examples, it is more likely to be healthy.
To my mind, people, who are against watching sports, do not take into consideration personal circumstances. There are a lot of people, who do not have possibilities for real sport activity, for example lack of equipment, professional trainers or even physical abilities. For these ones watching favorite sport events is the only way o feel united with community.
All in all, demonstration of sport events is the relevant way of spreading culture of movement among fans over social boundaries.
