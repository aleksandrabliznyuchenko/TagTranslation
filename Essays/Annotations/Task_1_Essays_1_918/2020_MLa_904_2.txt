Nowadays professional sport became significantly popular, people spend their leisure time on watching their favourite team scoring the goal. Some people claim that watching different kinds of sport is a completely lost time. This essay will disagree with this point of view due to ability of such hobby to change person's mood and to gain new connections.

In recent years human beings started to feel more and more depressed and forgotten. However, such events like football match or Olympics can easily help him fobid feeling under the weather and live in the moment with other fans. For instance, foreign student came from the opposite side of the world to study in Germany and now he feels the pressure of idea, that he will not be able to study at the same level as other sudents. By visiting such sports events he could easily free his mind of that kind of thoughts and live in moment with other fans.

He can always find a common theme to speak on with his collegues. We should not forget that new friends are dramatically important for teenagers.

To sum up, I believe that spending leisure time by visiting sport events or watching games on TV cannot be called a waste of person's time. First of all, due to the fact that it can distract human's focus on daily problems. Last but not least, it can help find new connections with new friends and become more socially active.
