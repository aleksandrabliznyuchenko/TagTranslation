Nowadays the point of view that watching sports doesn't worth the time spending on it prevails among the society. This position has its own strong and weak arguments, however I'd rather disagree with it due to a variety of reasons, which will be represented in my essay.
First of all, what can be said by haters of watching sports as the main arguments? They can claim, for instance, that it doesn't develop our health because of sitting for a long time without any movement. We are just sitting and looking at competitions or sports games and destruct our own health, while the athletes develop it. Moreover, watching sports can encourage us to spend a big amount of money on buying TV or uniform of our favourite team or, maybe, expansive tickets to the stadium, that don't cost such amount of money.
Nevertheless, I'm inclined to think that this reasons can't proof that watching sports is a waste of time. Firstly, there are too many activities by doing which we are just sitting on one place and don't move. For example, they are reading books or even listening for lecturer in a university, but we don't consider that these activities are useless. More than that, watching sports events can bring us a great pleasure. As for wasting money I can add that we also do it by a variety of other ways which could be buying goods in market that we will thew away later.
To draw the conclusion, I will claim that it is pretty difficult to find out bad sides of watching sports events and even the most obvious of them could be argued by the fact that there are a lot of similar activities which are believed to be a good choice just because the society is used to thing in such way. So, just give people the opportunity to choose what they want to watch on their own.
