Sport is very controversial issue in many ways. One of this questions is whether it is total waste of time not to do sport but inly watch it. Personally, I cannot agree on this point. And the purpose of this essay is to figure out my own position.
To start with, it is crucial to understand, why watching sport can be claimed to be useless. Firstly, supporters of this point of view often claim that it is absolutely unhealthy for this 'sport fans'. As watching TV can affect human's eyes or live sport events usually can be pretty dangerous because of the crowd everywhere. Secondly, watching sport is not similar with doing some physical activity, as it is usually about staying in one position for many hours.
However, the opponents of this view claim that watching some sports is quite great way to spend spare time. Firstly, people who prefer doing that usually do not underestimate importance of sport in their life, but they are not professionals in this. They just understand this as a possibility to glance at the world of 'Big Sport'. Moreover, watching sports make some special atmosphere that is good not only for people who watch it but also for sportsmen. Because they feel that they have some fans who support them and sometimes during some sport events this is vital for sportsmen to fell that they are being supported.
To sum up, there are different opinions on practically everything in life and sport is not an exception. But I guess that it is essential for people to have some hobbies and to be interested in something. In this way, watching sports is a great opportunity to spend free time as if both interesting and profitable for all. And what is more, it can be a chance to everyone to be a part of Sport as many people have some problems with health or financial difficulties and cannot participate in any physical activity on their own.
