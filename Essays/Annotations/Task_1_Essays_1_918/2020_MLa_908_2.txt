Nowadays the problem of watching various sports events either on TV or at live occasions is widely discussed all over the world. There is an opinion that doing these actions is nothing more than a waste of time. I completely disagree with this point of view because, to my mind, watching sports matches or competitions gives a person the sence of belonging and a lot of energy. This essay will explain my viewpoint in details.
First of all, the act of watching sports, especially at live events, is a great way for uniting people from different countries and of various nationalities. For instance, millions of people from all parts of the globe were ready to come to Russia for the EURO 2020 to watch football games. Those, who could not afford travelling, were getting ready to watch the matches on TV or through the usage of the Internet. If these plans had happened, football fans would deffinitely widen their knowlege about cultures, meet new people and, thus, expand their circles of friends. That is why watching sports plays both an entertaining, and a uniting role.
Moreover, what is extemely crucial about watching sports events is that it gives people an opportunity to get the amount of adrenaline and energy, without which men are not able to exist. For example, if a person works in an office, leads a very peaceful, but boring, life, watching sports might be the only way for him to get those needy emotions of surprise, fear and relief. All these aspects result in maintaining a person's psycological health and decrease the chances of becoming depressed in the future. Due to this reason watching sports is not only allowed, but needed for one's health.
To sum up, while there is an opinion that watching sports on TV or attending such events in reality is useless, I, in contrast, think that certain benefits of doing these actions can be identified. Not only does it play the educative and uniting role in people's lives, it also helps to stay emotionally balanced.
