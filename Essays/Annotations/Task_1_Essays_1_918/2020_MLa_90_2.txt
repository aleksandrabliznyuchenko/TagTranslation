There are a lot of sports shows or events in our modern world. A lot of persons think that it is a good way of spending your free time to watch sport competitions, while others insist on the fact that it is not true and you shouldn't watch these unpractical shows. In my opinion, it is a relaxing and normal to watch something connected with sport.
First of all, these events attract people to be healthy because you want to be and to try something like your favourite sport star. That is why you will want to do some exercises after watching an exiting sport event. So, It can be healthy for men or women if sport show will persuade them to do healthy training or game. On the other hand, it can be healthy even at home when you totally relaxing while watching complicated game without doing anything by your own.
Secondly, to be the fan of some team is a good hobby where you can meet new interesting people and find a special way of spending your free time. Furthermore, it is the easiest way of taking part in sport competitions because fan support is one of the most important and sophisticated part of sports like football, basketball, volleyball etc. Sometimes you can hear this phrase "fan is a twelve participant of football match" and I think it is true.
In conclusion, even though there are people who think that watching TV shows or sport competitions is a waste of your time, I do not support their point of view. In my personal opinion, there are a lot of benefits for us in watching sport events like relaxation, new friends or hobby and a healthy lifestyle.
