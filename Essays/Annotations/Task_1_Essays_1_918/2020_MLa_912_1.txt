On the scheme below we can see how the usage of Facebook changed from 2012 year to 2013 year.
In both years the percentage of using this site from the desktop is higher than the percentage of using it from the mobile phone. Despite this, in 2013 the number of people who used their mobile phones to use Facebook slightly increased.
The other scheme shows us the reasons why men and women use this site during both years. The charts tell us that women mostly spend their time in Facebook to share photos and wideos while men do not show much preferences because their percentage in using this site is pretty much the same in different scales. We can say that women have more contrast in their preferences.
These two schemes show us that in general people have the same reasons to use Facebook, but despite this fact there is a little difference between them in their preferences.
