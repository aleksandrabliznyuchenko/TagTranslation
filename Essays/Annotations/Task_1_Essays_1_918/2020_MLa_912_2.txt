Many people think that watching sports on TV is a waste of time. Such people are convinced that to understand the sports game, you need to play it yourself, and not watch it on TV or gadgets.
I do not agree with this position. I am deeply convinced that everyone finds something different in the sports game. For example, you can root for your favorite athlete and get no less emotions than when playing football on the field.
The second reason I believe my opinion is correct is that you can learn to play while watching the game on TV, because you learn the rules of the game while watching TV.
However, many people may disagree with my opinion. They will think that it is impossible to just look at the game and thus learn to play it, but it is necessary to take part in the game so that the body remembers the movements. Thus, sitting on the couch, the body does not move and does not remember the movements that are necessary for a high-quality game.
I can tell such people that even if the body does not remember the movements necessary for the game, while the person is sitting on the dvivana perp TV, this is not the main thing. The main thing is that all the rules and movements are memorized by his brain. Thus, it will be easier for a person to master the game or other sports activities if they go out on the field themselves. It will be easier for him to learn than for those who have never watched the game on TV before So I don't consider watching sports or exercising on TV a waste of time
