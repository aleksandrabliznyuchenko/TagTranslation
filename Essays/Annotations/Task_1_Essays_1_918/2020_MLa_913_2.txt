A lot of people believe that watching sports (either on TV or at live events) is a useless way to spend your time. I disagree with the following statement.
First of all, sport events can bring the atmosphere of brotherhood. Mostly of times, sport games is a competition of two opposite teams, and being the part of people sharing the same emotions of happiness or sorrow due to results of game is very cheerful. Secondly, sport games are usually fullfilled with many anxious moments, which make the game very interesting. Thirdly, watching sports on TV or live is a good reason to bring the friends altogether. Except watching the game, it is possible to communicate and to discuss some points of the game or even the team players, - it will help to get along and to vary the time. On the other hand, there can be another opinion which states that all of the following actions could be done without going to the sport events or enjoying it on TV. Sport event is a great reason to go out and to forget about daily routine. I am convinced that visiting the events is a significant motivator for those who wants to start doing physical activity and to be fit and healthy. Judging from my personal experience, all people from my surrounding are fascinating in doing sports as well as watching it. They got the inspiration from their role models, who are the world-famous sport stars.
Taking into consideration all mentioned above, i would say that watching sports on TV or visiting the events offline come along with a lot of positive things such as good company, amazing atmosphere and also can be an important motivator to watch one's health and physical activity, so i can barely confirm that it is the waste of time.
