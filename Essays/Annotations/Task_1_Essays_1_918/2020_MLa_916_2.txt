Sport now became a spectacular show, that people want to see. Thus, there are lots of those who are ready to spend their time on watching sports on TV or at sport events right on the place. Personnally, I disagree with the opinion that admiring sports is a wasting of time and in this essay I will try to prove my point of view.
To begin with, sport is very attractive, many people really admire different kind of sports such football, basketball, kickboxing and so on. The sport, as it has been already mentionned, became a spectacular show which may human feel thrilled or happy. This happens because of lack of emotions: that is to say that due to the daily routine people often do not feel them active, they are tired, because work like a dog. In this way watching sports transformates into a useful habit, which may help to feel better.
Moreover, people often watch sport not alone- the do it in a big funny company. Thanks to this particular habit friends, who did not have an opportunity to see each other in order to spend a leisure time together, may communicate and support favorite team or a admirable sportsmen.
To sum up, watching sport in various formats cannot be a waste of time, because it is considered as a daily activity which may be very useful somehow. For instence, in order to diversify the routine and relax or to feel extremelly different emotions and share our joy and happiness with friends.
