There are a lot of sport fans in the world who watch a lot of different sport events. But others think that watching sport is useless and is a waste of people's free time. On the one hand, it seems that watching sport events doesn't have any benifits. It won't make you more healthy, fit or smart. So one can say that doing sport or watching some educational programms is much better time spending. Also there are other types of entertaining like going to the cinema, where you get some important ideas to think about. Also some fans go crazy and hate each other.
On the other hand, watching sport is not only matching somebody playing something. First of all it motivates people to start doing sport. Of course not everybody who watch it is fit and healthy, but some people would see people playing football and gets into it. Also it is a good hobby. You can support team from your city for example, and when it wins, feel that you participated in this victory. It is good topic to have converstion too. A lot of people find good friends, becouse they support the same team.
So all in all I disagree whith the statement that watching sport is a waste of time. People must spend some time to entrtain themselves and it is not bad way to do that.
The main reason why I consider it good hobby, is that it connects people. People supporting one team are very helpful and kind to each other.
