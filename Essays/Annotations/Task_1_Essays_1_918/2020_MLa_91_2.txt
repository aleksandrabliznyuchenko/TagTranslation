Nowadays sport became a really important part of life. It is getting more and more popularity in society, people enjoy both going in for different sport and watching sport events, but some people are convinced that watching such events is a senseless activity. Actually, I can not agree with such position.
To begin with, watching sport is a real hobby, so it helps different people to relax. For elder people It gives quite a rare opportunity to relax and distract from that exhausting day at work, and after having rest people can return to their job with a proper level of concentration. As for the children, sport lets them to spend their energy after classes. As a result kids are not overfilled with energy and it is way more easy to cope with them.
In addition, watching sport gives a lot of motivation to people of all ages. Doing almost all types of sport requires a lot of physical and menthal force. Almost all sportsmen have overcome a plenty of challenging situations and became really strong personalities. When an ordinary peopleis looking at sportsmen's tough lives, they are keen to accept that level of motivation and direct it to their own lives. I had the same situation with the footbal player - Thierry Henry, which I am a great fun of.
In conclusion, despite some people are absolutely sure that watching sport is a waste of time, they have no chance to change my opinion on that issue. Watching sport is a really beneficial activity.
