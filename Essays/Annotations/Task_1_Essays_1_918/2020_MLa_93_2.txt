Sport belongs to the category of recreational hobbies that allow people to relax and get an adrenaline rush. So, there are people, who think, that such activity is too boring, but there those, who do like this area. in my opinion, any hobby has a right to exist as long as it has fans, that is why i am on the side of the second view, so, i disagree with this opinion.
The first reason why i agree is my conviction in idea that it is a way to relax and to take a break from the routine, there are such sport viewers tend to be the working people for whom observing the physical activity of others is a way of abstracting from their boring life. For example, the human came back home after a very hard day, in this case the worker does not want to do something himself, so the best solution is watching sports.
My second reason is the situation, when this hobby can be paired with meetings with your friends. It could be very fan to watch: for example football together, discussing what is going on. It is like the tool of motivation for interesting conversations.
on the other hand, the enjoyment of observing athletics performances is inappropriate. The person who watches does not participate himself, does not prove anything to public. He is only charged with energy emanating from the others.
In conclusion, i want to say, that in my opinion the fascination of some people with watching sports event is not a waste of time. that is just a way to relax from the routine and the desire to get a boost of energy and adrenaline. One way or another everyone can choose the favorite.
