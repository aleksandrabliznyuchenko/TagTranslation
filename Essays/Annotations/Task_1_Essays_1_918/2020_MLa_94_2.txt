Some people consider that watching sports is a waste of time no matter if it is shown in real stadium or on TV. However, I disagree with this point of view because in my opinion it is an exciting activity that has a lot of benefits.
To begin with, watching sports gives motivation to act and to do something, for example to start doing morning excercises or join the running community. Such impact is obviously useful and make people stronger and healthier. One more benefit is that while watching a certain kind of sport, people gain knowledge about it and get more versalite educated. In addition, watching sports with family or friends is a great way to spend leisure time together and share opinions during the game or a performance. This kind of free time brings people closer and creates topics for discussion.
Conversely, there are some arguments against watching sports. One such argument is that for many people it can be boring just because the rules are always the same and there are no updates. Another related argument is that the time spent on watching other people running or kicking the ball could be spent on something really useful for a personal growth like reading or doing sports yourself.
To conclude, there is a view that watching sports is killing time. In contrast to this opinion I would argue that it is a great way to spend time and get a lot of benefits. So, people should encourage their relatives and friends to develop interest in sports by watching it together.
