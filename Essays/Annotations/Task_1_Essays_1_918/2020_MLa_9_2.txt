There is an opinion that it is useless to observe any sport events, live or on television. Indeed, sports are designed to take part of activities, not just watching them. Although, I disagree, that passive attantion is just loosing time in some sense.
From the one hand, so many peolpe nawdays do not any physical activities, but wathing sports, what is seems to be confusing. It is more interesting to take part in competitions, run with a ball or speed up in a sport car, rather then lay down on the sofa near the TV-box or sit donw on the stadium in a crowd. Also, it looks rude to enjoy the way people are running, swimming or jumping at the edge of their abilities and watch it just for fun. It is evident, that observing sports is much more easier then try to do it by your own. Some people believe, that they can reach a lot of different aims insted of wasting their time on whathing how others do so.
From the over hand, it is usefull to be involved in the sports world and support it. For example, some kids, who observe how their favorite sportmens do their best, want to become so strong too and start to do exercises, what is good fo their helth. The wathing sport events in this way is a motivation to become better. Moreover, sport broadcasts keeps the interest to the sport on the high level, and sport associations get money from sponsors and goverments of their countries to improve and grow up new sport leaders. For instanse, the most popular intrnational copetitions have the biggest prize bank.
In conclusion, summing up all I mentioned before, the fact, that just watching sports is looking silly in some way, does not mean that it is absolutely useble and wasting your time. I agree, that the observing sport competitions is important for sport community and for motivating people to do physical activities and become better.
