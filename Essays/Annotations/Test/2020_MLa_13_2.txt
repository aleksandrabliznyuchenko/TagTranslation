Some of us believe that spending time in front of the TV watching sports is just a form of wasting time for nothing. I totally disagree with this statement. From my personal view, people should either watch sports or do sports.
The first reason why watching sports competitions is needed is because it can gather the whole family togetger, for example, wathing a football match can help to improve relationships between a father and a son, and maybe it can be the reason for the relatives to gather together and to avoid all the problems and misunderstanding between them. Moreover, watching sports can be very challenging, different people can be fond of different teams or players, so they can create a great discussion about this.
Secondly, watching sports on TV can help someone to find himself in the sports world. Maybe if a person sees the fantastic triumph of the swimmer, he will leave all his daily routine and go to the swimming pool to feel like he is winning the world championship, which will definetely better affect on his health, because it is undoubtedly that doing sport exercises is important for our body. Also if a child watches something sporty on TV, maybe he will also start doing sport, maybe he or she will become a famous sportsman in the future and their parents will be proud of them.
So, to sum up, I will argue that watching sports is an important part of our lives, we should not avoid it and it is totally wrong that watching sports is always just a kind of wasting time!
