Watching sports, both live and on TV, is sometimes claimed to be a waste of time. I strongly disagree with this opinion.
First of all, watching sport is an entertainment for millions of people. Fans and non-involved spectaculors are attracted to different types of sport by the competitive spirit and unique skills of professional sportsmen. People tend to enjoy watching others perform what they cannot do themselves - this is a milestone of almost any media content in the history. With sports, this element is accompanied by the emotion that athletes express during the game, induced by the competition for titles and fame.
Furthermore, watching sports can be very emotional if you support a team of your city or country. Almost everywhere this feeling of relation overcomes the interest of the game itself, therefore most fans attend matches of their city club inspite of relation, not passion for the sport itself. In terms of country, this bond is even more stronger. The result is that many people who may be not interested in a particular sport on a regular basis, watch games of their national team just because of patriotism.
Moreover, sports may be influencing for youth, motivating children to take up the sport they enjoy. A lot of professional athletes recall becoming keen on their particular sport by watching it on TV with their family as a child. Which is more, watching a sport one is fond of playing may help to improve personal skills. Children imitate the movements and behaviour of adults thus passing on the experience on to their generation.
To conclude, I believe watching sports may be very useful to a person. It stimulates energy and emotion, satisfies the need for aesthetics, unites people under their home club and motivates children to involve in healthy outdoor leisure.
