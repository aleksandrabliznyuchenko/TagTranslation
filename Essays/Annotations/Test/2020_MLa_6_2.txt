There are different opinions about if watching sports is a waste of time or not. I believe, this particular activity is a good one for resting, but I usually prefer to cook or read a book, if I am tired. Watching sports is very popular, but I don't think this is interesting for everyone.
For many people watching sports is an unnecessary part of their life and a preferable way of spending free time. Usually people, who enjoy watching sport competitions and championships, try to do sports. If they are football fans for example, they can play football with their friends and then spend time together watching a championship. This is beneficial for their health and social life. Also sometimes watching sports can lead to healthy lifestyle.
Some people don't watch sports, and sometimes they can even claim that watching sports is boring and it doesn't worth their time. I agree that sometimes people can waste their time on watching sports, but it is as probable as wasting time on the Internet or watching TV. These activities can't take a lot of time, if you have a schedual and to-do list and if know, when to work and when to rest.
To conclude, watching sports is not a waste of time with careful planning, it's a good activity for people who enjoy it. But this is absolutely okey to prefer different ways of spending free time, for example reading books or watching movies.
